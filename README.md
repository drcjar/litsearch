# Pubmed mining for occupational lung disease topics

## Introduction

* Keeping abreast of the literature is important and hard.

* Important because you can't do research, or clinical care, well without knowing what's known. Hard because the literature is large and imperfectly indexed.

* For my PhD on job exposures in IPF I've spent some time experimenting with the pubmed API (application programming interface) using Python and (mostly) the biopython library.

 ## What's an API?

 Briefly an application programming interface provides a means to access and use a thing (e.g pubmed) using a programming language (in this case Python).

 ## Why use an API?
 More options. Greater speed. Efficiency gains by automating search, storage and presentation of results.

 ## Why not use an API?

 * Need to learn to code. Probably will be a universal skill but is not yet.

 ## So what have you done?
 
 * I will (briefly) talk you through my initial pubmed mining experiments (full documented code online here: https://github.com/drcjar/litsearch/blob/master/litsearch.ipynb), take questions, and hear any feedback you have.

 * I'd also really like to learn about the techniques you use to research occupational lung disease topics and keep abreast of the literature.
