Different study designs and ways of measuring asbestos exposure e.g Epidemiological, observational, cross-sectional, cohort, case-control, post-mortem and explant studies, ecological, toxicology, animal models, molecular disease models, exposure assessment, occupational hygeinst measurements, minerologic analysis (tissue, BAL etc)\n",
