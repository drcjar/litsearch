    "### A notebook to support academic question exploration and literature search\n",
    "0. Define a research question e.g Is occupational **asbestos exposure** an underecognised **cause** of IPF? \n",
    "1. Consider the different possible ways of answering the question (methods). Different study designs and ways of measuring asbestos exposure e.g Epidemiological, observational, cross-sectional, cohort, case-control, post-mortem and explant studies, ecological, toxicology, animal models, molecular disease models, exposure assessment, occupational hygeinst measurements, minerologic analysis (tissue, BAL etc)\n",
    "2. Generate search terms e.g \"IPF\", \"case-control\", \"occupational\", \"asbestos\" (? && mesh terms)\n",
    "3. Carry out search using search terms and e.g pubmed, google scholar, clinicaltrials.gov, ?google books\n",
    "4. Search results == Candidate Papers\n",
    "5. Extract title | journal | author | location | year | abstract | key words | full text && save result (as .bib)\n",
    "6. Review Candidate Papers to identify Relevant Papers \n",
    "7. Use Relevant Papers to identify more Candidate papers. Search also by author, cited by, cite, [triangle closing](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Triadic_closure) and other means\n",
    "\n",
    "meta: github/stack exchange etc to check out other peoples search strategies. this is likely to be formulated as a machine learning problem somewhere."
