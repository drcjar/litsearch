    "1. Consider the different possible ways of answering the question (methods). Different study designs and ways of measuring asbestos exposure e.g Epidemiological, observational, cross-sectional, cohort, case-control, post-mortem and explant studies, ecological, toxicology, animal models, molecular disease models, exposure assessment, occupational hygeinst measurements, minerologic analysis (tissue, BAL etc)\n",
    "2. Generate search terms e.g \"IPF\", \"case-control\", \"occupational\", \"asbestos\" (? && mesh terms)\n",
    "3. Carry out search using search terms and e.g pubmed, google scholar, scopus, biorxiv, web of science, clinicaltrials.gov, ?google books\n",
    "4. Search results == Candidate Papers\n",
    "5. Extract title | journal | author | location | year | abstract | key words | full text && save result (as .bib) (prob want to export to jabref)\n",
    "6. Review Candidate Papers to identify Relevant Papers \n",

       "{'20362747': 'Idiopathic pulmonary fibrosis is a diffuse fibrotic lung disease of unknown etiology with no effective treatment. Emerging data support a role for chronic microaspiration (ie, subclinical aspiration of small droplets) in the pathogenesis and natural history of idiopathic pulmonary fibrosis. However, the precise relationship between chronic microaspiration and idiopathic pulmonary fibrosis remains unknown. Gastroesophageal reflux, a presumed risk factor for microaspiration, has been strongly associated with idiopathic pulmonary fibrosis with an estimated prevalence of up to 90%. This review aims to describe the relationship between chronic microaspiration and idiopathic pulmonary fibrosis by laying out the clinical and biologic rationale for this relationship and exploring the scientific evidence available. The gaps in our current understanding of the diagnosis of chronic microaspiration and idiopathic pulmonary fibrosis and the ongoing uncertainties in management and treatment will be highlighted. Defining the role of chronic microaspiration in idiopathic pulmonary fibrosis is essential as it has potential clinical, pathobiological, and treatment implications for this deadly disease.',\n",
       " '20484178': 'BACKGROUND: Sildenafil, a phosphodiesterase-5 inhibitor, may preferentially improve blood flow to well-ventilated regions of the lung in patients with advanced idiopathic pulmonary fibrosis, which could result in improvements in gas exchange. We tested the hypothesis that treatment with sildenafil would improve walk distance, dyspnea, and quality of life in patients with advanced idiopathic pulmonary fibrosis, defined as a carbon monoxide diffusion capacity of less than 35% of the predicted value. METHODS: We conducted a double-blind, randomized, placebo-controlled trial of sildenafil in two periods. The first period consisted of 12 weeks of a double-blind comparison between sildenafil and a placebo control. The primary outcome was the proportion of patients with an increase in the 6-minute walk distance of 20% or more. Key secondary outcomes included changes in oxygenation, degree of dyspnea, and quality of life. The second period was a 12-week open-label evaluation involving all patients receiving sildenafil. RESULTS: A total of 180 patients were enrolled in the study. The difference in the primary outcome was not significant, with 9 of 89 patients (10%) in the sildenafil group and 6 of 91 (7%) in the placebo group having an improvement of 20% or more in the 6-minute walk distance (P=0.39). There were small but significant differences in arterial oxygenation, carbon monoxide diffusion capacity, degree of dyspnea, and quality of life favoring the sildenafil group. Serious adverse events were similar in the two study groups. CONCLUSIONS: This study did not show a benefit for sildenafil for the primary outcome. The presence of some positive secondary outcomes creates clinical equipoise for further research.

       " '20838937': 'Idiopathic pulmonary fibrosis (IPF) is an interstitial lung disease (ILD) affecting the pulmonary interstitium. Other forms of interstitial lung disease exist, and in some cases, an environmental etiology can be delineated. The diagnosis of IPF is typically established by high-resolution CT scan. IPF tends to have a worse prognosis than other forms of ILD. Familial cases of IPF also exist, suggesting a genetic predisposition; telomerase mutations have been observed to occur in familial IPF, which may also explain the increase in IPF with advancing age. Alveolar epithelial cells are believed to be the primary target of environmental agents that have been putatively associated with IPF. These agents may include toxins, viruses, or the autoantibodies found in collagen vascular diseases. The mechanism of disease is still unclear in IPF, but aberrations in fibroblast differentiation, activation, and proliferation may play a role. Epithelial-mesenchymal transition may also be an important factor in the pathogenesis, as it may lead to accumulation of fibroblasts in the lung and a disruption of normal tissue structure. Abnormalities in other components of the immune system, including T cells, B cells, and dendritic cells, as well as the development of ectopic lymphoid tissue, have also been observed to occur in IPF and may play a role in the stimulation of fibrosis that is a hallmark of the disease. It is becoming increasingly clear that the pathogenesis of IPF is indeed a complex and convoluted process that involves numerous cell types and humoral factors.',\n",
       " '21057104': 'Idiopathic pulmonary fibrosis (IPF) is a disabling disease of the lung parenchyma, characterized by progressive accumulation of scar tissue and myofibroblast activation after repetitive epithelial microinjury. The therapeutic options are limited, and patients usually die within a few years after diagnosis. Pulmonary hypertension (PH) in IPF has been increasingly recognized as a condition with relevance for the overall prognosis. Treatment trials are being designed, but to be effective, it is crucial to better understand the pathobiology of PH in IPF: the traditional concept, that hypoxic vasoconstriction and accumulation of scar tissue are mainly responsible for the development of PH in IPF, has been challenged. Recent studies, including our own in vivo research, suggest that the underlying pathobiology is much more complex, and includes a complicated interaction of epithelial cells, fibroblasts, and vascular cells. This interaction seems to be regulated by a large variety of angiogenesis promoters and inhibitors, as well as growth factors. Central components seem to be endothelial apoptosis and growth factor-induced remodeling of the pulmonary artery wall. The present review gives a conceptual overview about known and putative mechanisms that are involved in the development of PH in IPF. This report summarizes currently available therapeutic options, and also translates experimental research to discuss potential novel biomarkers and therapeutic strategies derived from new concepts in pathogenesis.',\n",
       " '21068441': 'Idiopathic pulmonary fibrosis is characterized by diffuse alveolar damage and severe fibrosis, resulting in a steady worsening of lung function and gas exchange. Because idiopathic pulmonary fibrosis is a generally progressive disorder with highly heterogeneous disease progression, we classified affected patients as either rapid or slow progressors over the first year of follow-up and then identified differences between the two groups to investigate the mechanism governing rapid progression. Previous work from our laboratory has demonstrated that Toll-like receptor 9 (TLR9), a pathogen recognition receptor that recognizes unmethylated CpG motifs in bacterial and viral DNA, promotes myofibroblast differentiation in lung fibroblasts cultured from biopsies of patients with idiopathic pulmonary fibrosis. Therefore, we hypothesized that TLR9 functions as both a sensor of pathogenic molecules and a profibrotic signal in rapidly progressive idiopathic pulmonary fibrosis. Indeed, TLR9 was present at higher concentrations in surgical lung biopsies from rapidly progressive patients than in tissue from slowly progressing patients. Moreover, fibroblasts from rapid progressors were more responsive to the TLR9 agonist, CpG DNA, than were fibroblasts from slowly progressing patients. Using a humanized severe combined immunodeficient mouse, we then demonstrated increased fibrosis in murine lungs receiving human lung fibroblasts from rapid progressors compared with mice receiving fibroblasts from slowly progressing patients. This fibrosis was exacerbated by intranasal CpG challenges. Furthermore, CpG induced the differentiation of blood monocytes into fibrocytes and the epithelial-to-mesenchymal transition of A549 lung epithelial cells.

We compared the alteration of these lymphatics and lymphangiogenesis among idiopathic pulmonary fibrosis and nonfibrotic interstitial pneumonias with a better prognosis. METHODS AND RESULTS: The lung tissue specimens of eighteen patients with idiopathic pulmonary fibrosis (ten surgical biopsies and eight autopsies), six with organizing pneumonia, six with cellular nonspecific interstitial pneumonia, and five normal controls were examined by morphometric analysis of the lymphatics identified by immunohistochemistry. In addition, three-dimensional reconstruction of lymphatics, apoptosis of lymphatic endothelial cells and the cells producing growth factors for lymphangiogenesis were also evaluated. Both the subpleural and the interlobular lymphatics in idiopathic pulmonary fibrosis lungs were significantly decreased in the severe fibroconnective lesions, with rare lymphangiogenesis. The three-dimensional images of the subpleural lymphatics in idiopathic pulmonary fibrosis clearly revealed destruction by fibrosis; apoptosis was observed in these lymphatic endothelial cells. In contrast, organizing pneumonia and cellular nonspecific interstitial pneumonia preserved these lymphatics, and active lymphangiogenesis occurred in the alveolar lesions. CONCLUSIONS: These results reveal severe damage of the subpleural and interlobular lymphatics in idiopathic pulmonary fibrosis lungs, and suggest impaired alveolar clearance as another pathogenesis of its refractoriness.',\n",

OBJECTIVE: To investigate the association between COX2.3050 (G --> C), COX2.8473 (C --> T) and COX2.926 (G --> C) single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNP) and the susceptibility to idiopathic pulmonary fibrosis and the progression of the disease. DESIGN: Genetic polymorphisms were analyzed in 121 out of 225 available control subjects and in all of 174 patients with idiopathic pulmonary fibrosis by real time polymerase chain reaction. Logistic regression analysis of covariance and chi-squares test were used for statistical analysis. RESULTS: While analysis of disease development did not find any significant association with single SNP genotype, a haplotype analysis revealed a strong association between the disease development and one haplotype [GC] at loci COX2.3050 and COX2.8473, and suggested a recessive genetic effect of this haplotype. Further analysis concluded that subjects having two copies of [GC] haplotype, or equivalently (GG/CC) genotype at the two SNPs, had an increased risk after adjusting for age and sex. Due to the interaction, this elevated risk increased slowly with age, and the estimated odds ratio (OR) decreased with age from OR = 1.4 at age 30 to OR = 1 at age 74 and OR = 0.96 at age SO. The OR was significantly greater than 1 up to age 66, and not significant for age older than 66. Therefore, the recessive effect of [GC] haplotype increased the risk of IPF of subjects younger than 66 years, but its effect diminished for seniors older than 66. One hundred and forty-nine patients with idiopathic pulmonary fibrosis were followed up for 33.7 +/- 2.1 months. Further analysis of disease progressions, defined by the changes in pulmonary function tests, did not reveal any association with either SNP genotypes or haplotypes. CONCLUSIONS: The carriage of double homozygote (GG/CC) at the SNP loci of COX2.3050 and COX2.8473 polymorphisms may increase the susceptibility to idiopathic pulmonary fibrosis, by approximately 1.4 folds at age 30 and by a smaller fold greater than 1 up to age 66 years, but not the progression of the disease. These findings may help to improve our understanding of idiopathic pulmonary fibrosis pathogenesis and may lead to the development of new therapeutic strategies.',\n",

The aim of this study was to determine the prognostic value of cardio-pulmonary exercise testing (CPET) in patients with IPF. A multicentre retrospective study of 3-year outcome was made on 63 adult patients with IPF who underwent CPET with blood gas analysis. Demographic data, resting pulmonary function and CPET parameters were collected to perform a univariate survival analysis. To estimate prognosis at 3 years, a multivariate logistic regression analysis by Kaplan-Meier curves and log-rank tests was performed. Forty-four patients (70%) were alive without lung transplant at the end of the 3-year follow-up: 19 patients (30%) were dead (n=14) or transplanted (n=5). Univariate analysis indicated that: at rest lower TLC, FVC, DLCO and PaCO(2), higher alveolo-arterial gradient for oxygen [P(A-a)O(2)] and pH; at ventilatory threshold (VT) higher VE/VO(2) and VE/VCO(2) and at peak exercise higher VE/VO(2) and VE/VCO(2), higher pH and DeltaP(A-a)O(2)/DeltaVO(2) (mmHg/L), lower VO(2) peak, PaO(2) and VO(2)/FC were associated with a significantly lower survival at 3 years. The multivariate logistic regression analysis showed that CPT (<65%) and VE/VO(2) at VT (>45) were independently associated with a lower survival at 3 years. Restriction and hyperventilation at ventilatory threshold are major prognostic factors in the course of IPF. CPET with blood gas analysis may have a prognostic value in these patients and initial evaluation of these parameters can help to predict disease progression.',\n",

In study 006, 171 of 344 patients were assigned to pirfenidone 2403 mg/day, and 173 to placebo. All patients in both studies were analysed. In study 004, pirfenidone reduced decline in FVC (p=0.001). Mean FVC change at week 72 was -8.0% (SD 16.5) in the pirfenidone 2403 mg/day group and -12.4% (18.5) in the placebo group (difference 4.4%, 95% CI 0.7 to 9.1); 35 (20%) of 174 versus 60 (35%) of 174 patients, respectively, had a decline of at least 10%. A significant treatment effect was noted at all timepoints from week 24 and in an analysis over all study timepoints (p=0.0007). Mean change in percentage FVC in the pirfenidone 1197 mg/day group was intermediate to that in the pirfenidone 2403 mg/day and placebo groups.

IPF is the most common and severe of the idiopathic interstitial pneumonias, with most individuals progressing to respiratory failure. Multiple lines of evidence reveal prominent roles for alveolar epithelial cells (AECs) in disease. The current disease paradigm is that ongoing or repetitive injurious stimuli in the presence of a genetic or acquired dysfunctional type II AEC phenotype results in increased AEC injury/apoptosis, deficiencies in regeneration of normal alveolar structure and aberrant lung repair and fibroblast activation, leading to progressive fibrosis. Although the nature of injurious events and processes involved in aberrant repair of the alveolar epithelium are not well understood, ongoing investigations provide hope to better understand mechanisms by which AECs maintain homeostasis or contribute to fibrosis.

OBJECTIVES: Develop a practical mortality risk scoring system for patients with idiopathic pulmonary fibrosis. METHODS: We used a Cox proportional hazards model and data from two clinical trials (n = 1,099) to identify independent predictors of 1-year mortality among patients with idiopathic pulmonary fibrosis. From the comprehensive model, an abbreviated clinical model comprised of only those predictors that are readily and reliably ascertained by clinicians was derived. Beta coefficients for each predictor were then used to develop a practical mortality risk scoring system. MEASUREMENTS AND MAIN RESULTS: Independent predictors of mortality included age, respiratory hospitalization, percent predicted FVC, 24-week change in FVC, percent predicted carbon monoxide diffusing capacity, 24-week change in percent predicted carbon monoxide diffusing capacity, and 24-week change in health-related quality of life. An abbreviated clinical model comprising only four predictors (age, respiratory hospitalization, percent predicted FVC, and 24-wk change in FVC), and the corresponding risk scoring system produced estimates of 1-year mortality risk consistent with observed data (9.9% vs. 9.7%; C statistic = 0.75; 95% confidence interval, 0.71-0.79). CONCLUSIONS: The prognosis for patients with idiopathic pulmonary fibrosis may be accurately determined using four readily ascertainable predictors. Our simplified scoring system may be a valuable tool for determining prognosis and guiding clinical management.

The fibroblast and myofibroblast foci secrete excessive amounts of extracellular matrix, mainly collagens, resulting in scarring and destruction of the lung architecture. The mechanisms that link idiopathic pulmonary fibrosis with ageing and aberrant epithelial activation are unknown; evidence suggests that the abnormal recapitulation of developmental pathways and epigenetic changes have a role.

Delays in accessing subspecialty care could lead to worse outcomes among those with idiopathic pulmonary fibrosis. OBJECTIVES: To examine the association between delayed access to subspecialty care and survival time in idiopathic pulmonary fibrosis. METHODS: We performed a prospective cohort study of 129 adults who met American Thoracic Society criteria for idiopathic pulmonary fibrosis evaluated at a tertiary care center. Delay was defined as the time from the onset of dyspnea to the date of initial evaluation at a tertiary care center. We used competing risk survival methods to examine survival time and time to transplantation. MEASUREMENTS AND MAIN RESULTS: The mean age was 63 years and 76% were men. The median delay was 2.2 years (interquartile range 1.0-3.8 yr), and the median follow-up time was 1.1 years. Age and lung function at the time of evaluation did not vary by delay. A longer delay was associated with an increased risk of death independent of age, sex, forced vital capacity, third-party payer, and educational attainment (adjusted hazard ratio per doubling of delay was 1.3, 95% confidence interval 1.03 to 1.6). Longer delay was not associated with a lower likelihood of undergoing lung transplantation.

Sigmoidal equations have been used to fit pressure-volume curves for mechanically ventilated patients but not for idiopathic pulmonary fibrosis patients. We compared a sigmoidal model and an exponential model to fit pressure-volume curves from mechanically ventilated patients with idiopathic pulmonary fibrosis. METHODS: Six idiopathic pulmonary fibrosis patients and five controls underwent inflation pressure-volume curves using the constant-flow technique during general anesthesia prior to open lung biopsy or thymectomy. We identified the lower and upper inflection points and fit the curves with an exponential equation, V = A-B.e-k.P, and a sigmoid equation, V = a+b/(1+e-(P-c)/d). RESULTS: The mean lower inflection point for idiopathic pulmonary fibrosis patients was significantly higher (10.5 +/- 5.7 cm H2O) than that of controls (3.6 +/- 2.4 cm H(2)O). The sigmoidal equation fit the pressure-volume curves of the fibrotic and control patients well, but the exponential equation fit the data well only when points below 50% of the inspiratory capacity were excluded. CONCLUSION: The elevated lower inflection point and the sigmoidal shape of the pressure-volume curves suggest that respiratory system compliance is decreased close to end-expiratory lung volume in idiopathic pulmonary fibrosis patients under general anesthesia and mechanical ventilation. The sigmoidal fit was superior to the exponential fit for inflation pressure-volume curves of anesthetized patients with idiopathic pulmonary fibrosis and could be useful for guiding mechanical ventilation during general anesthesia in this condition.',\n",

Because the signaling pathways activated by several tyrosine kinase receptors have been shown to be involved in lung fibrosis, it has been suggested that the inhibition of these receptors may slow the progression of idiopathic pulmonary fibrosis. METHODS: In a 12-month, phase 2 trial, we assessed the efficacy and safety of four different oral doses of the tyrosine kinase inhibitor BIBF 1120 as compared with placebo in patients with idiopathic pulmonary fibrosis. The primary end point was the annual rate of decline in forced vital capacity (FVC). Secondary end points included acute exacerbations, quality of life (measured with the St. George's Respiratory Questionnaire [SGRQ]), and total lung capacity. RESULTS: A total of 432 patients underwent randomization to receive one of four doses of BIBF 1120 (50 mg once a day, 50 mg twice a day, 100 mg twice a day, or 150 mg twice a day) or placebo. In the group receiving 150 mg of BIBF 1120 twice a day, FVC declined by 0.06 liters per year, as compared with 0.19 liters per year in the placebo group, a 68.4% reduction in the rate of loss with BIBF 1120 (P = 0.06 with the closed testing procedure for multiplicity correction; P = 0.01 with the hierarchical testing procedure). This dose also resulted in a lower incidence of acute exacerbations, as compared with placebo (2.4 vs. 15.7 per 100 patient-years, P = 0.02) and a small decrease in the SGRQ score (assessed on a scale of 0 to 100, with lower scores indicating better quality of life) as compared with an increase with placebo (-0.66 vs. 5.46, P = 0.007). Gastrointestinal symptoms (which led to more discontinuations in the group receiving 150 mg twice a day than in the placebo group) and increases in levels of liver aminotransferases were more frequent in the group receiving 150 mg of BIBF 1120 twice daily than in the placebo group. CONCLUSIONS: In patients with idiopathic pulmonary fibrosis, BIBF 1120 at a dose of 150 mg twice daily, as compared with placebo, was associated with a trend toward a reduction in the decline in lung function, with fewer acute exacerbations and preserved quality of life.

       " '22287606': 'While the factors that regulate the onset and progression of idiopathic pulmonary fibrosis (IPF) are incompletely understood, recent investigations have revealed that endoplasmic reticulum (ER) stress and activation of the unfolded protein response (UPR) are prominent in alveolar epithelial cells in this disease. Initial observations linking ER stress and IPF were made in cases of familial interstitial pneumonia (FIP), the familial form of IPF, in a family with a mutation in surfactant protein C (SFTPC). Subsequent studies involving lung biopsy specimens revealed that ER stress markers are highly expressed in the alveolar epithelium in IPF and FIP. Recent mouse modeling has revealed that induction of ER stress in the alveolar epithelium predisposed to enhanced lung fibrosis after treatment with bleomycin, which is mediated at least in part by increased alveolar epithelial cell (AEC) apoptosis. Emerging data also indicate that ER stress in AECs could impact fibrotic remodeling by altering inflammatory responses and inducing epithelial-mesenchymal transition. Although the cause of ER stress in IPF remains unknown, common environmental exposures such as herpesviruses, inhaled particulates, and cigarette smoke induce ER stress and are candidates for contributing to AEC dysfunction by this mechanism. Together, investigations to date suggest that ER stress predisposes to AEC dysfunction and subsequent lung fibrosis. However, many questions remain regarding the role of ER stress in initiation and progression of lung fibrosis, including whether ER stress or the UPR could be targeted for therapeutic benefit.',\n",

Changes in the fibrous lesion on sequential CTs were assessed as visual score by two radiologists. We measured the volume and change per year of fibrous pattern (F-pattern) quantitatively using a computer-aided system on sequential CTs. RESULTS: The baseline vital capacity (%pred VC) was 74.0 +/- 14.0% in the pirfenidone group and 74.6 +/- 16.6% in controls (p=NS). Deterioration of respiratory status was defined as 10% or greater decline in %pred VC value after 12-month treatment. A significantly larger proportion of pirfenidone-treated patients showed stable respiratory status (21 of 38, 65.6%) than the control (15 of 40, 37.5%). The change in fibrous lesion was significantly smaller in the pirfenidone group than the control in both of visual score (p=0.006) and computer analysis (p<0.001).

METHODS: This was a double-blind, randomized, placebo-controlled trial of warfarin targeting an international normalized ratio of 2.0 to 3.0 in patients with IPF. Subjects were randomized in a 1:1 ratio to warfarin or matching placebo for a planned treatment period of 48 weeks.

MEASUREMENTS AND MAIN RESULTS: The primary outcome measure was the composite outcome of time to death, hospitalization (nonbleeding, nonelective), or a 10% or greater absolute decline in FVC. Due to a low probability of benefit and an increase in mortality observed in the subjects randomized to warfarin (14 warfarin versus 3 placebo deaths; P = 0.005) an independent Data and Safety Monitoring Board recommended stopping the study after 145 of the planned 256 subjects were enrolled (72 warfarin, 73 placebo).

Epidemiological evidence suggests that patients with IPF have an increased risk of developing lung cancer. Carcinoembryonic antigen (CEA) has a close association with epithelial malignancy. The aim of this study was to evaluate serum CEA concentrations in patients with IPF and to perform correlation with pulmonary function. METHODS: Serum CEA concentrations were measured by two-site sequential chemiluminescent immunometric assay in 41 non-smoking patients with IPF. Patients with a history of gastrointestinal tract malignancy or other disorder known to be associated with raised serum CEA were excluded. RESULTS: A total of 41 patients were evaluated. The mean (+/-standard deviation) age of patients was 73 +/- 7 years. The mean (+/-standard deviation) forced vital capacity was 88 +/- 20% of predicted, and the mean (+/-standard deviation) diffusing factor for carbon monoxide (DLco) was 52 +/- 19% of predicted. Twenty-one (51%) patients had a serum CEA concentration higher than upper limit of the normal range (0-5 ng/mL). CEA concentration was significantly negatively correlated with lung function (P = 0.005; R(2) = 0.20 for forced vital capacity and P = 0.006; R(2) = 0.20 for DLco). Raised CEA level also correlated significantly with the extent of fibrosis. A lung biopsy specimen from a patient with IPF demonstrated strong staining for CEA in metaplastic epithelium lining the honeycombed cysts and respiratory bronchioles.

Individuals with Familial Pulmonary Fibrosis (FPF) have at least one affected first or second-degree relative and account for 0.5-20% of cases. METHODS: We ascertained and collected DNA samples from a large population-based cohort of IPF patients from Newfoundland, Canada. For each proband, a family history was documented and medical records were reviewed. Each proband was classified as familial (28 patients) or sporadic (50 patients) and all 78 probands were screened for variants in four highly penetrant, adult-onset PF genes (SFTPC, SFTPA2, TERT,TERC). RESULTS: Seventy-eight IPF probands were enrolled of whom 28 (35.9%) had a positive family history. These 28 familial patients led to the recruitment of an additional 49 affected relatives (total of 77 FPF patients). By age 60 years, 42% of the familial cohort had been diagnosed with PF compared with only 16% of the sporadic patient collection (chi2 = 8.77, p = 0.003). Mean age of diagnosis in the familial group was significantly younger than the sporadic group (61.4 years vs. 66.6 yrs, p = 0.012) with a wider age range of diagnosis (19-92 years compared with 47-82 years). Thirty-three of 77 (42.8%) FPF patients had a tissue diagnosis and all but five had usual interstitial pneumonia histology. Compared with other published case series, the familial IIP histologies were more homogeneous. Three of 28 familial probands (10.7%) and none of the 50 sporadic probands had pathogenic variants in the four genes tested. All three familial probands had mutations in TERT. Other phenotypes associated with telomerase deficiency were present in these families including cirrhosis, bone marrow hypoplasia and premature graying. Telomere length assays were performed on mutation carriers from two families and confirmed telomere-related deficiency. CONCLUSION: The proportion of familial cases in our cohort is higher than any previously reported estimate and we suggest that this is due to the fact that Newfoundland cohort is ethnically homogeneous and drawn from a founder population. In our patient collection, diagnosis with IPF prior to age 45 years predicted familial disease. In two of the three TERT mutation families, the pedigree appearance is consistent with genetic anticipation. In the other 25 FPF families negative for mutations in known PF genes, we did not identify other telomerase associated medical problems (bone marrow dysfunction, cirrhosis) and we hypothesize that there are novel PF genes segregating in our population.',\n",

However, no studies have been reported regarding the development of nontuberculous mycobacterium (NTM) lung disease (NTMLD). We reviewed 795 patients with IPF from five university hospitals who were diagnosed by histological or radio-clinical criteria. In the 795 patients with IPF, pulmonary infections with mycobacterium tuberculosis (MTB) and NTM were found in 35 (4.4%) and 16 patients (2.0%), respectively, which was a higher frequency than that found in the general population. TB was more common in patients treated with immunosuppressants than in those who did not receive immunosuppressants (2.6% vs 1.4%, P = 0.12). Among the IPF patients who had mycobacterial infections,immunosuppressant users developed TB or NTMLD within 1 yr after treatment with immunosuppressants,while those occurred later than 2 yr after diagnosis of IPF in the subjects that did not receive immunosuppressants. Among 51 IPF patients who had mycobacterial infections, 9 (18%) died during follow-up. Of these, three died due to progression of pulmonary tuberculosis. TB and NTMLD is relatively common in patients with IPF in Korea and may be fatal in some groups. Careful evaluation of TB and NTMLD is necessary not only for immunosuppressant users, but also for nonusers with IPF.',\n",

Lymphangiogenesis plays an important role in tissue inflammation and tumour cell dissemination. Lymphatic involvement is seen in lymphangioleiomyomatosis (LAM) and idiopathic pulmonary fibrosis (IPF). LAM, a disease primarily affecting females, involves the lung (cystic destruction), kidney (angiomyolipoma) and axial lymphatics (adenopathy and lymphangioleiomyoma). LAM occurs sporadically or in association with tuberous sclerosis complex (TSC). Cystic lung destruction results from proliferation of LAM cells, which are abnormal smooth muscle-like cells with mutations in the TSC1 or TSC2 gene. Lymphatic abnormalities arise from infiltration of LAM cells into the lymphatic wall, leading to damage or obstruction of lymphatic vessels. Benign appearing LAM cells possess metastatic properties and are found in the blood and other body fluids. IPF is a progressive lung disease resulting from fibroblast proliferation and collagen deposition. Lymphangiogenesis is associated with pulmonary destruction and disease severity. A macrophage subset isolated from IPF bronchoalveolar lavage fluid (BALF) express lymphatic endothelial cell markers in vitro, in contrast to the same macrophage subset from normal BALF.

A population of 126 IPF patients was recruited. A high prevalence of PH (39.7%, 50/126), evaluated by echocardiography on the basis of PAPs greater than 36 mmHg, was mainly observed in smokers and female patients. Regression analysis revealed a significant correlation between PAPs greater than 50 mmHg and DLCO/VA (p = 0.0294). Mean PAPs was significantly greater one year after onset of PH (p = 0.01). 11/21 patients with FVC less than 50% had a significant increase in PAPs one year after onset of PH (p = 0.02). There was a highly significant difference between survival of IPF patients with and without PH (p = 0.0001; hazard ratio = 3.56). This study revealed that PH has a high prevalence in patients with IPF and is associated with increased risk of mortality.

The objective of the present study was to evaluate the clinical significance of PAR-2 expression in the alveolar epithelial cells of IPF patients. PAR-2 expression was evaluated by immunohistochemical method in formalin-fixed and paraffin-embedded tissues of surgical lung biopsies from patients with IPF. Fibrosis scores from hematoxylin and eosin-stained lung sections and honeycombing scores in chest CT were calculated. Medical records were retrospectively reviewed and the correlation between the expression of PAR-2 and clinical profiles were assessed. Among thirty-three IPF patients, PAR-2 expression was observed in 25 (75.8%). The lymphocyte counts in peripheral blood (2317 vs. 1753, p = 0.044) and honeycombing scores in chest CT (4.0 vs. 3.0 p = 0.046) were higher in PAR-2 positive group compared with PAR-2 negative group. During a follow-up duration of median 40.3 months, 7 (21.2%) patients died and they were all included in the PAR-2 positive group (p = 0.113).

OBJECTIVES: To define the relationship between Sema 7a and lymphocytes in IPF. METHODS: We characterized the significance of Sema 7a+ lymphocytes in humans with IPF and in a mouse model of lung fibrosis caused by lung-targeted, transgenic overexpression of TGF-beta1. We determined the site of Sema 7a expression in human and murine lungs and circulation and used adoptive transfer approaches to define the relevance of lymphocytes coexpressing Sema7a and the markers CD19, CD4, or CD4+CD25+FoxP3+ in TGF-beta1-induced murine lung fibrosis. MEASUREMENTS AND MAIN RESULTS: Subjects with IPF show expression of Sema 7a on lung CD4+ cells and circulating CD4+ or CD19+ cells. Sema 7a expression is increased on CD4+ cells and CD4+CD25+FoxP3+ regulatory T cells, but not CD19+ cells, in subjects with progressive IPF. Sema 7a is expressed on lymphocytes expressing CD4 but not CD19 in the lungs and spleen of TGF-beta1-transgenic mice. Sema 7a expressing bone marrow-derived cells induce lung fibrosis and alter the production of T-cell mediators, including IFN-gamma, IL-4, IL-17A, and IL-10. These effects require CD4 but not CD19. In comparison to Sema 7a-CD4+CD25+FoxP3+ cells, Sema7a+CD4+CD25+FoxP3+ cells exhibit reduced expression of regulatory genes such as IL-10, and adoptive transfer of these cells induces fibrosis and remodeling in the TGF-beta1-exposed murine lung.

However, whether PH is a predictor of survival remains unclear in milder cases. OBJECTIVES: To evaluate the survival impact of pulmonary artery pressure measured during the initial evaluation in patients with IPF. METHODS: We retrospectively analyzed the initial evaluation data of 101 consecutive IPF patients undergoing right heart catheterization. Patients evaluated with supplemental oxygen were excluded. Predictors of 5-year survival were analyzed using the Cox proportional model. RESULTS: The mean forced vital capacity (FVC) % predicted, diffusing capacity of the lung for carbon monoxide (DLCO) % predicted, and mean pulmonary artery pressure (MPAP) were 70.2 +/- 20.1%, 47.9 +/- 19.5%, and 19.2 +/- 6.5 mm Hg, respectively. A univariate Cox proportional hazard model showed that the body mass index, %FVC, %DLCO, baseline PaO2, modified Medical Research Council score, 6-min walk distance, and lowest SpO2 of the 6-min walk test were significantly predictive of survival. The MPAP and pulmonary vascular resistance of right heart catheterization were also significant. With stepwise, multivariate Cox proportional analysis, MPAP (HR = 1.064; 95% CI 1.015-1.116, p = 0.010) and %FVC (HR = 0.965, 95% CI 0.949-0.982, p < 0.001) were independent determinants of survival. Analysis of the receiver operating curve revealed MPAP >20 mm Hg to be optimal for predicting the prognosis. CONCLUSIONS: Higher MPAP and lower %FVC at the initial evaluation were significant independent prognostic factors of IPF. The current results suggested the importance of the initial evaluation of PH for patients with IPF.',\n",

We set out to verify whether this variant is also a risk factor for fibrotic lung disease in other settings and to confirm the published findings in a UK Caucasian IPF population. METHODS: Caucasian UK healthy controls (n=416) and patients with IPF (n=110), sarcoidosis (n=180) and systemic sclerosis (SSc) (n=440) were genotyped to test for association. The SSc and sarcoidosis cohorts were subdivided according to the presence or absence of fibrotic lung disease. To assess correlation with disease progression, time to decline in forced vital capacity and/or lung carbon monoxide transfer factor was used in the IPF and SSc groups, while a persistent decline at 4 years since baseline was evaluated in patients with sarcoidosis. RESULTS: A significant association of the MUC5B promoter single nucleotide polymorphism with IPF (p=2.04 x 10(-17); OR 4.90, 95% CI 3.42 to 7.03) was confirmed in this UK population. The MUC5B variant was not a risk factor for lung fibrosis in patients with SSc or sarcoidosis and did not predict more rapidly progressive lung disease in any of the groups. Rather, a trend for a longer time to decline in forced vital capacity was observed in patients with IPF. CONCLUSIONS: We confirm the MUC5B variant association with IPF. We did not observe an association with lung fibrosis in the context of SSc or sarcoidosis, potentially highlighting fundamental differences in genetic susceptibility, although the limited subgroup numbers do not allow a definitive exclusion of an association.',\n",

OBJECTIVES: The study aimed to assess early EPCs levels and EPCs endogenous vascular endothelial growth factor (VEGF) expression in IPF. In order to examine alterations in the mobilization of EPCs from the bone marrow we measured plasma VEGF. MAIN RESULTS: Twenty-three patients with IPF and fifteen healthy subjects were included. The number of early EPCs colonies was markedly reduced in IPF patients vs controls (6.00+/-6.49 vs 49.68+/-16.73, respectively, p<0.001). EPCs were further decreased in patients presenting systolic pulmonary arterial pressure (sPAP)>/=35 mmHg. The number of colonies per well correlated negatively with P((A-a))O(2) (r = -0.750, p<0.001). Additionally, VEGF mRNA levels were significantly increased in IPF patients. There were no differences observed in VEGF plasma levels in IPF patients when compared to controls. CONCLUSIONS: The current data suggest that inadequate levels of early EPCs may potentially contribute to suppressed repair and recovery of the damaged pulmonary endothelium and thereby may drive the sequence of events in profibrogenic direction. Increased VEGFmRNA levels in the clinical context of IPF may represent a compensatory mechanism to overcome reduced EPCs levels.',\n",

We sought to determine the prevalence, clinical features, and prognosis of CPFE in idiopathic pulmonary fibrosis (IPF), using a standardized and reproducible definition. METHODS: Patients with IPF were identified from two ongoing cohorts. Two radiologists scored emphysema and fibrosis severity on high-resolution CT (HRCT) scans. CPFE was defined as >/=10% emphysema on HRCT scan. Clinical characteristics and outcomes of patients with CPFE and IPF and those with non-CPFE IPF were compared with unadjusted analysis and then analysis after adjustment for HRCT fibrosis score. Mortality was compared using competing risks regression to handle lung transplantation. Sensitivity analyses were performed using Cox proportional hazards, including time to death (transplantation censored) and time to death or transplant. RESULTS: CPFE criteria were met in 29 of 365 patients with IPF (8%), with high agreement between radiologists (kappa=0.74). Patients with CPFE had less fibrosis on HRCT scans and higher FVC, but greater oxygen requirements (P</=.01 for all comparisons). Findings were maintained with adjustment for fibrosis severity. Inhaled therapies for COPD were used by 53% of patients with CPFE. There was no significant difference in mortality comparing patients with CPFE and IPF to those with non-CPFE IPF (hazard ratio, 1.14; 95% CI, 0.61-2.13; P=.69).

METHODS: A retrospective review was conducted of 132 patients diagnosed with IPF at the National Research Institute of Tuberculosis and Lung Diseases (NRITLD) in Tehran, Iran from 1988 through 2008. Data were collected from the medical records which consisted of demographics, clinical history, laboratory tests, pulmonary function tests (PFT), radiographic and pathology findings, treatment, and outcomes of the disease. RESULTS: The mean age at diagnosis was 56.6 years (95% CI: 53.8 - 59.4) with no significant sex predilection. Common presenting symptoms included dyspnea and cough, which occurred for a mean period of 21 months prior to diagnosis. Common signs included end-inspiratory crackles and digital clubbing, which were found in 85.6% and 55.3% of the patients, respectively. Radiographically, reticular and reticulonodular opacities were seen in 47.3% and 20.9% of the patients, respectively on high resolution computed tomography (HRCT). In patients who underwent lung biopsy, diffuse interstitial fibrosis was seen in 91.1%. The mean follow-up time for all patients was 32.8 months (95% CI: 23.2 - 42.4, range: 1 - 257 months).

In this study, serum HSP47 levels were evaluated to elucidate pathogenic differences involving HSP47 between AE-IPF and stable (S)-IPF. Subjects comprised 20 AE-IPF and 33 S-IPF patients. Serum levels of HSP47, Krebs von den Lungen-6 (KL-6), surfactant protein (SP)-A, SP-D, and lactate dehydrogenase (LDH) were measured. Immunohistochemical analysis of lung HSP47 expression was determined in biopsy and autopsy tissues diagnosed as diffuse alveolar damage (DAD) and usual interstitial pneumonia (UIP).

The hallmarks of the histopathology, which is characteristic of usual interstitial pneumonia (UIP) pattern, include interstitial fibrosis, honeycomb changes and fibroblast foci that develop owing to fibroblast proliferation and excessive matrix deposition. Although the complete pathomechanism is not yet understood, several molecular culprits, including transforming growth factor (TGF)-beta, Angiotensin (Ang) II, endothelin (ET)-1, matrix metalloproteinases (MMPs) and cytokines have been identified. IPF is increasingly believed to be an epithelial-driven disease; however, the literature does support an implication of altered immune response and inflammatory processes in the onset or progression of the disease. Mast cells (MCs) are multifunctional tissue resident cells involved in the inflammatory and immune response. An increasing body of evidence suggests a role of MCs and their mediator chymase in the pathology of IPF. With regard to the underlying mechanisms, it is conceivable that MC chymase may function via activation or processing of factors such as proteases, cytokines and growth factors. In this review, we will discuss how MC chymase is linked to and can potentially contribute to the development of IPF.

Different clinical and morphological variables were studied by univariate and multivariate analyses at time of transplant and in the early post-transplant period. The same lung tissue analyses were performed in MHV-68 infected mice. RESULTS: A higher frequency of virus positive cases was found in IPF patients than in controls (p = 0.0003) and only herpes virus genomes were detected. Viral cases showed higher mPAP (p = 0.01), poorer performance in the six minute walking test (6MWT; p = 0.002) and higher frequency of primary graft (PGD) dysfunction after lung transplant (p = 0.02). Increased arterial thickening, particularly of the intimal layer (p = 0.002 and p = 0.004) and higher TGF-beta expression (p = 0.002) were demonstrated in viral cases.

Treatment with GRN510 at 10 mg/kg/day activated telomerase 2-4 fold both in hematopoietic progenitors ex vivo and in bone marrow and lung tissue in vivo, respectively. Telomerase activation was countered by co-treatment with Imetelstat (GRN163L), a potent telomerase inhibitor. In this model of bleomycin-induced fibrosis, treatment with GRN510 suppressed the development of fibrosis and accumulation of senescent cells in the lung via a mechanism dependent upon telomerase activation. Treatment of small airway epithelial cells (SAEC) or lung fibroblasts ex vivo with GRN510 revealed telomerase activating and replicative lifespan promoting effects only in the SAEC, suggesting that the mechanism accounting for the protective effects of GRN510 against induced lung fibrosis involves specific types of lung cells.

As an attempt to improve the predictive nature of this model, integrative bioinformatic approaches were used to compare molecular alterations in the lungs of bleomycin-treated mice and patients with IPF. Using gene set enrichment analysis we show for the first time that genes differentially expressed during the fibrotic phase of the single challenge bleomycin model were significantly enriched in the expression profiles of IPF patients. The genes that contributed most to the enrichment were largely involved in mitosis, growth factor, and matrix signaling. Interestingly, these same mitotic processes were increased in the expression profiles of fibroblasts isolated from rapidly progressing, but not slowly progressing, IPF patients relative to control subjects. The data also indicated that TGFbeta was not the sole mediator responsible for the changes observed in this model since the ALK-5 inhibitor SB525334 effectively attenuated some but not all of the fibrosis associated with this model. Although some would suggest that repetitive bleomycin injuries may more effectively model IPF-like changes, our data do not support this conclusion.

We consider that only two different yet complementary and realistic approaches could lead to earlier diagnosis of IPF and possibly to allowing more efficient disease management: 1) investigating any patients with early Velcro crackles at lung auscultation through proactive education of, and commitment from, primary care physicians; and 2) using current large-scale lung cancer screening strategies with low-dose high-resolution computed tomography in smokers for the detection of subclinical interstitial lung disease and especially early IPF.',\n",

This prospective, randomised, double-blind, multicentre, parallel-group, placebo-controlled phase II trial (NCT00903331) investigated the efficacy and safety of the endothelin receptor antagonist macitentan in idiopathic pulmonary fibrosis. Eligible subjects were adults with idiopathic pulmonary fibrosis of <3 years duration and a histological pattern of usual interstitial pneumonia on surgical lung biopsy. The primary objective was to demonstrate that macitentan (10 mg once daily) positively affected forced vital capacity versus placebo. Using a centralised system, 178 subjects were randomised (2:1) to macitentan (n=119) or placebo (n=59). The median change from baseline up to month 12 in forced vital capacity was -0.20 L in the macitentan arm and -0.20 L in the placebo arm. Overall, no differences between treatments were observed in pulmonary function tests or time to disease worsening or death. Median exposures to macitentan and placebo were 14.5 months and 15.0 months, respectively. Alanine and/or aspartate aminotransferase elevations over three times upper limit of normal arose in 3.4% of macitentan-treated subjects and 5.1% of placebo recipients.

However, so far, the impact of IPF-related sleep breathing disorders (SBDs) on survival has not been extensively studied. METHODS: In a cohort of 31 (24 males) treatment-naive, newly diagnosed consecutive IPF patients, we prospectively investigated the relationship of SBD parameters such as apnea-hypopnea index (AHI), maximal difference in oxygen saturation between wakefulness and sleep (maxdiff SpO2), and lowest sleep oxygen saturation (lowest SpO2) with clinical (survival, dyspnea, daytime sleepiness), pulmonary function, submaximal (6-min walk test [6MWT]) and maximal exercise variables (cardiopulmonary exercise test [CPET]), and right ventricular systolic pressure (RVSP). RESULTS: Sleep oxygen desaturation exceeded significantly that of maximal exercise (p < 0.001). Maxdiff SpO2 was inversely related to survival, DLCO%, and SpO2 after 6MWT, and directly with dyspnea, AHI, and RVSP. The lowest SpO2 was directly related to survival and to functional (TLC%, DLCO%) as well as submaximal and maximal exercise variables (6MWT distance, SpO2 after 6MWT, peak oxygen consumption/kg, SpO2 at peak exercise), while an inverse association with dyspnea score, AHI, and RVSP was observed. CONCLUSIONS: Our findings provide evidence that intermittent sleep oxygen desaturation significantly exceeds that of maximal exercise and is associated with survival in IPF patients. Furthermore, they imply the existence of a link between lung damage and apnea events resulting to the induction and severity of intermittent sleep oxygen desaturation that aggravate pulmonary arterial hypertension and influence IPF survival.',\n",

The individual genetic background, as well as exposure to a variety of toxic substances (cigarette smoke in primis) can contribute significantly to accelerating pulmonary senescence. Premature aging can impair lung function by different ways: by interfering specifically with tissue repair mechanisms after damage, thus perturbing the correct crosstalk between mesenchymal and epithelial components; by inducing systemic and/or local alteration of the immune system, thus impairing the complex mechanisms of lung defense against infections; and by stimulating a local and/or systemic inflammatory condition (inflammaging). According to recently proposed pathogenic models in COPD and IPF, premature cellular senescence likely affects distinct progenitors cells (mesenchymal stem cells in COPD, alveolar epithelial precursors in IPF), leading to stem cell exhaustion. In this review, the large amount of data supporting this pathogenic view are discussed, with emphasis on the possible molecular and cellular mechanisms leading to the severe parenchymal remodeling that characterizes, in different ways, these deadly diseases.',\n",

The goals of the present study were to identify lung transplant patients at the greatest risk of aspiration and to investigate the causative factors. MATERIALS AND METHODS: From September 2009 to November 2011, 252 bronchoalveolar lavage fluid (BALF) samples were collected from 100 lung transplant patients. The BALF pepsin concentrations and the results of transbronchial biopsy, esophageal function testing, barium swallow, and gastric emptying scan were compared among those with the most common end-stage lung diseases requiring lung transplantation: IPF, chronic obstructive pulmonary disease, cystic fibrosis, and alpha1-antitrypsin deficiency. RESULTS: Patients with IPF had higher BALF pepsin concentrations and a greater frequency of acute rejection than those with alpha1-antitrypsin deficiency, cystic fibrosis, or chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (P = 0.037). Moreover, the BALF pepsin concentrations correlated negatively with a lower esophageal sphincter pressure and distal esophageal amplitude; negatively with distal esophageal amplitude and positively with total esophageal acid time, longest reflux episode, and DeMeester score in those with chronic obstructive pulmonary disease; and negatively with the upright acid clearance time in those with IPF. CONCLUSIONS: Our results suggest that patients with IPF after lung transplantation are at increased risk of aspiration and a greater frequency of acute rejection episodes, and that the risk factors for aspiration might be different among those with the most common end-stage lung diseases who have undergone lung transplantation. These results support the role of evaluating the BALF for markers of aspiration in assessing lung transplant patients as candidates for antireflux surgery.',\n",

The aim of this study was to investigate the safety and efficacy of pirfenidone in patients with mild-to-severe IPF in clinical practice. METHODS: The clinical records of 76 patients who were diagnosed with IPF and received pirfenidone were reviewed. RESULTS: The most frequent adverse event was anorexia, although the grade of anorexia in most patients was mild. Dose reduction of pirfenidone improved anorexia in 84% affected patients, which resulted in a high medication compliance rate. The mean forced vital capacity (FVC) at the initiation of pirfenidone therapy in this study was approximately 10% lower than that in previous clinical trials. The mean change in FVC during the 6-month period prior to the therapy initiation was -188 mL, which improved to -19 mL during the 6-month period after therapy. Significant attenuation in percentage predicted diffusion capacity of the lung for carbon monoxide decline was also achieved after pirfenidone therapy initiation. The efficacy of pirfenidone in attenuating the degree of FVC decline was higher in the group with FVC decline of >/=150 mL during the 6-month period prior to therapy initiation. The levels of serum markers, such as KL-6 and SP-D, were also lowered by the therapy.

METHODS: Of the 117 patients diagnosed as IPF for the first time in the First Affiliated Hospital of China Medical University from January 2002 to January 2007, 23 cases met the diagnostic criteria for combined pulmonary fibrosis and emphysema (CPFE). Thirty-three cases with isolated IPF from 2002 to 2003 were selected as the control group. Clinical characteristics, pulmonary function indexes, PaO(2), bronchoalveolar lavage fluid (BALF) results and survival time were retrospectively analyzed and compared between the 2 groups. RESULTS: The smoking indexes (pack-years)were significantly higher in the CPFE group (28 +/- 18) compared with the IPF group (18 +/- 16), t = 2.10, P < 0.05. No significant difference was observed between the 2 groups in terms of age, gender and the percentage of smokers.

Intrapulmonary processes were evaluated by immunohistochemistry. Plasma B lymphocyte stimulating factor (BLyS) was assayed by ELISA. Circulating B cells of IPF subjects were more Ag differentiated, with greater plasmablast proportions (3.1 +/- 0.8%) than in normal controls (1.3 +/- 0.3%) (p < 0.03), and the extent of this differentiation correlated with IPF patient lung volumes (r = 0.44, p < 0.03). CD20(+) B cell aggregates, diffuse parenchymal and perivascular immune complexes, and complement depositions were all prevalent in IPF lungs, but much less prominent or absent in normal lungs. Plasma concentrations of BLyS, an obligate factor for B cell survival and differentiation, were significantly greater (p < 0.0001) in 110 IPF (2.05 +/- 0.05 ng/ml) than among 53 normal (1.40 +/- 0.04 ng/ml) and 90 chronic obstructive pulmonary disease subjects (1.59 +/- 0.05 ng/ml). BLyS levels were uniquely correlated among IPF patients with pulmonary artery pressures (r = 0.58, p < 0.0001).

According to the current pathogenic hypothesis, chronic damage of the alveolar epithelium is followed by abnormal tissue repair and impairment of the alveolar structure. This process is driven by pathogenic events very similar to cancer, including epigenetic and genetic changes, altered response to regulatory signals, abnormal expression of microRNAs and activation of specific signalling pathways. IPF also resembles cancer with regard to its poor response to medical treatment and prognosis, which is very often worse than many cancers. We have hypothesised that IPF might be assimilated to a neoproliferative disorder of the lung. Viewing IPF as a cancer-like disease may satisfy the need for a better understanding of the pathogenesis of IPF by exploiting the large amount of knowledge that cancer biology evokes. The recognition of common pathogenic pathways between the two diseases may stimulate new clinical trials with cancer drugs, different drug combinations and different lines of drugs, as already experimented in oncology.

Those that have, point to viruses playing a key role as cofactors in the initiation and progression of IPF. There is also some evidence to suggest that viral infection may be responsible for a proportion of acute exacerbations of IPF. The role played by bacteria in the pathogenesis of IPF is less clear cut. Studies from other respiratory diseases suggest that alterations in the lung microbiome are associated with disease and that these changes influence disease behaviour. Emerging molecular microbiological techniques are making the study of microbial communities in the lung easier. It is hoped that by combining such techniques with the careful longitudinal phenotyping of patients with IPF, it will be possible to elucidate the role played by bacteria and viruses in the pathogenesis of the disease.

We found that in the early injury or inflammation of the animal model, BLM promoted the development of inflammation, leading to severe pulmonary fibrosis. Then the expression of TGF-beta1 and Smad3 increased. Activated Smad3 bound to the IL-31 promoter region, followed by the activation of JAK-STAT pathways. The inhibitor of TGF-beta1 receptor decreased the IL-31 expression and knocking-down of IL-31 also decreased the STAT1 expression.

Episodes of rapid deterioration are not uncommon, often following a period of stability. In cases of uncertain etiology, with typical clinical and high-resolution computed tomography (HRCT) features, the term 'acute exacerbation of IPF' (AE-IPF) has been coined to describe a combination of diffuse alveolar damage and preexisting usual interstitial pneumonia. In 2007, a consensus definition and diagnostic criteria were proposed. Although the presence of overt infection is currently an exclusion criterion, it appears likely that occult infection, reflux and thoracic surgical procedures are all trigger factors for AE-IPF. The development of new, usually bilateral infiltrates (ground-glass attenuation with variable admixed consolidation) is a defining HRCT feature. The outcome is poor with a short-term mortality in excess of 50% despite therapy. A number of pathophysiologic pathways are activated, with immunologic dysregulation, epithelial damage and circulating fibrocytes all believed to play a pathogenetic role. Acute exacerbations are less prevalent in other fibrotic lung diseases than in IPF and may have a better outcome, with the exception of acute exacerbations of rheumatoid lung. In AE-IPF, the exclusion of alternative causes of rapid deterioration, including heart failure and infection, is the main goal of investigation.

This procedure is clinically impractical for many patients with pulmonary fibrosis, and a noninvasive strategy for measuring alphavbeta6 integrin levels in the lungs is urgently required to facilitate monitoring of disease progression and therapeutic responses. METHODS: Using a murine model of bleomycin-induced lung injury, we assessed the binding of intravenously administered (111)In-labeled alphavbeta6-specific (diethylenetriamine pentaacetate-tetra [DTPA]-A20FMDV2) or control (DTPA-A20FMDVran) peptide by nanoSPECT/CT imaging. Development of fibrosis was assessed by lung hydroxyproline content, and alphavbeta6 protein and itgb6 messenger RNA were measured in the lungs. RESULTS: Maximal binding of (111)In-labeled A20FMDV2 peptide to alphavbeta6 integrins was detected in the lungs 1 h after intravenous administration. No significant binding was detected in mice injected with control peptide. Integrin binding was increased in the lungs of bleomycin-, compared with saline-, exposed mice and was attenuated by pretreatment with alphavbeta6-blocking antibodies.

Cardiopulmonary exercise testing (CPET) can be used to detect less advanced pulmonary vascular impairment, and therefore may be of prognostic use. We studied the predictive value of non-invasive exercise parameters that were associated with elevated systolic pulmonary artery pressure (sPAP) for survival in IPF patients. METHODS: From our interstitial lung disease database, we reviewed records of consecutive patients with IPF in whom CPET and echocardiography were performed within 2 weeks (n = 38). RESULTS: Eleven patients (29%) had increased sPAP (>/=40 mm Hg). From all non-invasive CPET parameters, only the ventilatory equivalent for CO2 (V'E /V'CO2 ) at anaerobic threshold differed significantly between patients with and without sPAP >/= 40 mm Hg. The receiver-operator characteristic curve for V'E /V'CO2 resulted in areas under the curve of 0.77 (95% CI: 0.569-0.970; P = 0.026), with a cut-off value for predicting sPAP >/= 40 mm Hg of >45.0. Patients with V'E /V'CO2 > 45.0 had significantly worse survival compared with patients with V'E /V'CO2 </= 45.0 (P = 0.001). In contrast, sPAP did not predict survival. CONCLUSIONS: V'E /V'CO2 , the only CPET parameter associated with elevated sPAP, appears a potentially useful non-invasive marker for early detection of pulmonary vascular impairment, and therefore may be of use for a more accurate prognostic assessment in IPF patients.\",\n",

Fibroblasts are regarded as the major cell type that mediates the onset and progression of lung fibrosis by secreting large amounts of extracellular matrix (ECM) proteins, such as connective tissue growth factor (CTGF/CCN2). Current knowledge confers a crucial role of CCN2 in lung fibrosis. CCN5, another member of the CCN family, has been suggested to play an inhibitory role in some fibrotic diseases, such as cardiac fibrosis. However, the role of CCN5 in the process of IPF remains unknown. In the present study, using western blot analysis, we demonstrate that CCN2 is highly expressed in fibroblasts derived from IPF tissue, but is only slightly expressed in normal human lung fibroblasts. However, CCN5 was weakly expressed in all the above cells. qRT-PCR revealed that transforming growth factor (TGF)-beta1 stimulation increased CCN2 expression in the IPF-derived cultures of primary human lung fibroblasts (PIFs) in a time- and concentration-dependent manner, but only slightly affected the expression of CCN5. The overexpression of CCN5 induced by the transfection of PIFs with recombinant plasmid did not affect cell viability, proliferation and apoptosis; however, it significantly suppressed the expression of CCN2, alpha-smooth muscle actin (alpha-SMA) and collagen type I. The TGF-beta1-induced upregulation of the phosphorylation of Akt was reversed by CCN5 overexpression. Our results also demonstrated that adenovirus-mediated CCN5 overexpression in a mouse model of bleomycin-induced IPF significantly decreased the hydroxyproline content in the lungs, as well as TGF-beta1 expression in bronchoalveolar lavage fluid. Taken together, our data demonstrate that CCN5 exerts an inhibitory effect on the fibrotic phenotypes of pulmonary fibroblasts in vitro and in vivo, and as such may be a promising target for the treatment of IPF.',\n",

OBJECTIVES: The aim of this study was to determine the prevalence and intensity of accumulation of alveolar epithelial lining fluid (ELF) iron and of alveolar macrophage hemosiderin in IPF and its relationship with disease severity. METHODS: Forty seven IPF patients and 14 healthy controls were retrospectively evaluated for iron accumulation in the lower respiratory tract using total iron spectrophotometric measures and for hemosiderin accumulation using the Perls' stain with the Golde score. MEASUREMENTS AND MAIN RESULTS: Total iron levels in ELF were significantly increased in IPF patients compared to non-smoking controls (p < 0.05); there were no differences with healthy smokers (p = 0.2). Hemosiderin accumulation in alveolar macrophages was similar in never smoking and ever smoking IPF patients (p = 0.5), was significantly higher in IPF patients than in both smoking and non-smoking healthy controls (p < 0.05, all comparisons) and was positively correlated with echocardiographic estimates of pulmonary artery systolic pressure (p < 0.05) and with increasing disease severity scores (p < 0.05). CONCLUSIONS: The data show exaggerated accumulation of iron in IPF broncho-alveolar ELF and alveolar cells with no association with tobacco smoke, thus suggesting, occult pulmonary hemorrhage as a likely cause.\",\n",

In the setting of connective tissue diseases (CTDs), some measures of ILD disease activity and severity may be confounded by non-pulmonary comorbidities. METHODS: The Connective Tissue Disease associated Interstitial Lung Disease (CTD-ILD) working group of Outcome Measures in Rheumatology-a non-profit international organisation dedicated to consensus methodology in identification of outcome measures-conducted a series of investigations which included a Delphi process including >248 ILD medical experts as well as patient focus groups culminating in a nominal group panel of ILD experts and patients. The goal was to define and develop a consensus on the status of outcome measure candidates for use in randomised controlled trials in CTD-ILD and idiopathic pulmonary fibrosis (IPF). RESULTS: A core set comprising specific measures in the domains of lung physiology, lung imaging, survival, dyspnoea, cough and health-related quality of life is proposed as appropriate for consideration for use in a hypothetical 1-year multicentre clinical trial for either CTD-ILD or IPF. As many widely used instruments were found to lack full validation, an agenda for future research is proposed.

       " '24376648': 'Idiopathic pulmonary fibrosis (IPF) is a progressive and life threatening disease with median survival of 2.5-3 years. The IPF lung is characterized by abnormal lung remodeling, epithelial cell hyperplasia, myofibroblast foci formation, and extracellular matrix deposition. Analysis of gene expression microarray data revealed that cartilage oligomeric matrix protein (COMP), a non-collagenous extracellular matrix protein is among the most significantly up-regulated genes (Fold change 13, p-value <0.05) in IPF lungs. This finding was confirmed at the mRNA level by nCounter(R) expression analysis in additional 115 IPF lungs and 154 control lungs as well as at the protein level by western blot analysis. Immunohistochemical analysis revealed that COMP was expressed in dense fibrotic regions of IPF lungs and co-localized with vimentin and around pSMAD3 expressing cells. Stimulation of normal human lung fibroblasts with TGF-beta1 induced an increase in COMP mRNA and protein expression. Silencing COMP in normal human lung fibroblasts significantly inhibited cell proliferation and negatively impacted the effects of TGF-beta1 on COL1A1 and PAI1. COMP protein concentration measured by ELISA assay was significantly increased in serum of IPF patients compared to controls. Analysis of serum COMP concentrations in 23 patients who had prospective blood draws revealed that COMP levels increased in a time dependent fashion and correlated with declines in force vital capacity (FVC). Taken together, our results should encourage more research into the potential use of COMP as a biomarker for disease activity and TGF-beta1 activity in patients with IPF. Hence, studies that explore modalities that affect COMP expression, alleviate extracellular matrix rigidity and lung restriction in IPF and interfere with the amplification of TGF-beta1 signaling should be persuaded.',\n",

METHODS: We examined response data for the 21 physical activity items (the first 21 of 24) from the University of California San Diego Shortness of Breath Questionnaire (UCSD) collected at baseline in a recently conducted IPF trial. We used Rasch analysis and hypothesis testing with conventional statistical methodology to achieve three objectives: 1) to examine the items to identify the one characteristic that distinguishes one from another; 2) to asses these items for their ability to measure dyspnea severity in IPF; 3) to use the items to develop a dyspnea ruler. RESULTS: The sample comprised 178 subjects. The 21 items fit the Rasch model. There was very strong correlation between Rasch item severity and their metabolic equivalents (METS) values (r = -0.86, p < 0.0001). With the sample stratified on scores from the 21 items, there were significant between group differences in FVC%, DLCO% and distance walked during the six-minute walk test. The dyspnea ruler can be used to put dyspnea levels in a more easily understood clinical context. CONCLUSIONS: The first 21 items from the UCSD compose a unidimensional dyspnea-with-activity scale and are both sensibly ordered and distinguished from each other by their METS values. These 21 items can be used confidently to formulate clinically-relevant inferences about IPF patients and should be considered for use as a meaningful endpoint in IPF research.',\n",

Data on rates of infection is sparse; the effect of low-dose corticosteroids and disease severity is unknown. METHODS: We identified randomised-controlled trials of IPF and analysed rates of mortality, lower respiratory tract infections (LRTIs), IPF progression and acute exacerbations from the placebo arms. We standardised event rates and compared differences using incidence rate ratios (IRRs) between subgroups according to disease severity or use of low-dose immunosuppression. RESULTS: Mortality was lower in trials that recruited patients with mild-moderate disease severities only, as compared to trials where patients with severe disease were allowed (188.6 vs 78.6 deaths per 1000 patient/years, IRR 0.30-0.59, p < 0.0001). No statistical difference was seen between trials permitting and excluding low-dose prednisolone use. LRTIs were found to be commoner in trials allowing low dose prednisolone use compared with those that did not (227.1 vs 63.4 infections per 1000 patient/years. IRR 2.56-5.13, p < 0.0001), and were less frequent in trials excluding patients with severe disease (153.9 vs 257.8 infections per 1000 patient/years, IRR 0.45-0.81, p = 0.0003). Acute exacerbations occurred less frequently in trials excluding severe disease (28.2 vs 122.9 exacerbations per 1000 patient/years, IRR 0.11-0.55, p < 0.0001). There was no difference between groups in rates of IPF progression. CONCLUSION: Mortality is heterogeneous and dependent on entry criteria. Infection rates were high, both with and without immunosuppression, and were higher in severe disease.

Smoking appears to be the predominant risk factor for this disorder. We aimed to compare clinical features, smoking history, physiological and radiological findings between IPF with and without emphysema. METHODS: A sample of 125 IPF patients over a period of 48 months were evaluated. High resolution CT scans were reviewed blinded to clinical data. The IPF patients with or without emphysema were classified accordingly. RESULTS: The prevalence of emphysema in this IPF sample was 70/125. IPF with emphysema was significantly associated with smoking status (OR 63; 95% CI 4.4 to 915; P = 0.002) and smoking pack year (OR 1.1; 95% CI 1.05 to 1.13; P = 0.000). The patients with IPF and emphysema had a higher decrease in carbon monoxide diffusing capacity adjusted for alveolar volume ((58+/-19)% pred vs. (66+/-21)% pred; P = 0.021) and a higher prevalence of pulmonary hypertension (24/70 vs. 7/55; P = 0.006). The two groups of patients had similar forced and residual volumes. No significant differences were found in cell differentials of bronchoalveolar lavage or the scores of fibrosis on chest CT. Survival of the patients with emphysema was significantly less than that of patients with IPF alone. CONCLUSIONS: Cigarette smoking induces IPF combined with emphysema. Emphysema further impairs physiological function and increases the prevalence of pulmonary hypertension that leads to poor prognosis. The inclusion of the patients with combined pulmonary fibrosis and emphysema in IPF clinical trials may lead to under evaluation of the effect of treatment in patients.',\n",

METHODS: Eight consecutive male patients diagnosed with IPF were prospectively recruited to undergo full pulmonary function tests, high-resolution computed tomography of the thorax and PET/CT. The corrected mean SUV (rSUVmean) and corrected maximum SUV (rSUVmax) against the mediastinal blood pool were correlated with clinical parameters. Examinations were repeated 6 months later in six patients (2/8 patients had died) and changes were evaluated. Correlation was assessed by Spearman's rank correlation, and statistical significance was considered when the P-value was less than 0.05. RESULTS: The rSUVmean in IPF was negatively correlated with FVC (r=-0.6, P=0.024) and diffusing capacity for carbon monoxide (r=-0.7, P=0.010). The decline in FVC was associated with an increment in rSUVmax (r=-0.9, P=0.019), but no similar observation was made with total CT score (r=-0.1, P=0.787). CONCLUSION: Pulmonary metabolism, rSUVmean, contributes to the functional status of IPF patients, and changes in rSUVmax may serve as an adjunct surrogate marker to FVC in evaluating the disease status in IPF patients.\",\n",

Its prevalence is 2-29 per 100,000 persons and its incidence approximately 10 per 100,000 persons per year, with an upward trend. METHOD: Selective literature search in the EMBASE and PubMed databases for pertinent publications from 1996 to 2012, with special attention to randomized controlled trials. RESULTS: IPF manifests itself clinically with exertional dyspnea, dry cough, and inspiratory crepitations (sclerosiphonia). The diagnosis is confirmed by the demonstration of a usual interstitial pneumonia (UIP) pattern in a high-resolution thin-slice CT (HRCT) of the lungs, or else histologically by lung biopsy, along with the exclusion of other causes such as asbestosis or connective tissue disease. In 15 randomized controlled therapeutic trials carried out since 2004, most of the drugs that were tested, including immune suppressants, were found to be ineffective against IPF or even harmful. Only pirfenidone lessens the annual reduction of pulmonary volume (FVC, forced expiratory vital capacity) and of the distance walked in 6 minutes by about 30%, with corresponding improvement of progression-free survival, but without any significant lessening of overall mortality (placebo, 10%; pirfenidone, 8%). Pirfenidone also commonly causes gastrointestinal and cutaneous side effects. The efficacy of N-acetyldysteine and nintedanib has not yet been definitively demonstrated. Lung transplantation is the only current treatment that enables long-term survival. CONCLUSION: IPF has a worse prognosis than many types of cancer.

The pathogenesis of IPF remains unclear but repeated alveolar epithelial cell (AEC) injuries and subsequent apoptosis are believed to be among the initiating/ongoing triggers. However, the precise mechanism of apoptotic induction is hitherto elusive. In this study, we investigated expression of a panel of pro-apoptotic and cell cycle regulatory proteins in 21 IPF and 19 control lung tissue samples. We reveal significant upregulation of the apoptosis-inducing ligand TRAIL and its cognate receptors DR4 and DR5 in AEC within active lesions of IPF lungs. This upregulation was accompanied by pro-apoptotic protein p53 overexpression. In contrast, myofibroblasts within the fibroblastic foci of IPF lungs exhibited high TRAIL, DR4 and DR5 expression but negligible p53 expression. Similarly, p53 expression was absent or negligible in IPF and control alveolar macrophages and lymphocytes. No significant differences in TRAIL expression were noted in these cell types between IPF and control lungs. However, DR4 and DR5 upregulation was detected in IPF alveolar macrophages and lymphocytes. The marker of cellular senescence p21(WAF1) was upregulated within affected AEC in IPF lungs. Cell cycle regulatory proteins Cyclin D1 and SOCS3 were significantly enhanced in AEC within the remodelled fibrotic areas of IPF lungs but expression was negligible in myofibroblasts. Taken together these findings suggest that, within the remodelled fibrotic areas of IPF, AEC can display markers associated with proliferation, senescence, and apoptotosis, where TRAIL could drive the apoptotic response. Clear understanding of disease processes and identification of therapeutic targets will direct us to develop effective therapies for IPF.',\n",

Patients with IPF with and without positive serologies were compared. RESULTS: Three hundred eighty-nine consecutive patients with biopsy-confirmed IPF underwent serologic testing, with positive serologic test results being found in 112 (29%). Of 2051 individual screening serologic tests performed, results of 163 tests were positive (8%), with antinuclear antibody being the most frequent (47%). There was no difference in age at biopsy (P=.21), gender (P=.21), or presenting radiologic features between those with or without positive serology. More frequent use of immunosuppressive treatment (P=.02) was noted in those with positive serology. No survival difference was observed (log-rank; P=.43).

IPF is strongly associated with cigarette smoking and is predominantly a disease of ageing. However, its cause(s) remain elusive and, thus, it is one of the most challenging diseases for the development of novel effective and safe therapies. With the approval of pirfenidone for patients with mild-to-moderate IPF, an earlier diagnosis of IPF is a prerequisite for earlier treatment and, potentially, improvement of the long-term clinical outcome of this progressive and ultimately fatal disease. An earlier diagnosis may be achieved in IPF by promoting thin-slice chest high-resolution computed tomography screening of interstitial lung disease as a \"by-product\" of large-scale lung cancer screening strategies in smokers, but other techniques, which have been neglected in the past, are now available.

However, the biopathological processes linking aging with IPF and the mechanisms responsible for the abnormal activation of epithelial cells and fibroblasts have not been elucidated. Many of the hallmarks of aging (e.g., genomic instability, telomere attrition, epigenetic alterations, mitochondrial dysfunction, and cellular senescence) have been proposed as essential mechanisms for the development of IPF; however, these disturbances are not restricted to IPF and also occur in other aging-related lung disorders, primarily chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD). Therefore, an unanswered question is why a current/former smoker of about 60 years of age with shorter telomeres, alveolar epithelial senescence, excessive oxidative stress, and mitochondrial dysfunction develops IPF and not COPD; in other words, what makes old lungs specifically susceptible to develop IPF? In this Perspective, we propose an integral model in which the combination of some gene variants and/or gene expression in the aging lung results in the loss of epithelial integrity and consequently in the failure of the alveoli to correctly respond to injury and to face the stress associated with mechanical stretch. Afterward, a distinctive epigenetic \"reprogramming\" that affects both epithelial cells and fibroblasts provokes, among others, the recapitulation of developmental pathways and the aberrant activation and miscommunication between both cell types, resulting in the exaggerated production and accumulation of extracellular matrix and the subsequent destruction of the lung architecture.',\n",

Chromatin immunoprecipitation (ChIP) and re-ChIP assays demonstrated marked increases in H3K9me3, H3K27me3, and DNA methylation, together with their respective modifying enzymes G9a, EZH2, and DNA methyltransferases (Dnmts) and respective binding proteins heterochromatin protein 1 (HP1), polycomb protein complex 1 (PRC1) and methyl CpG binding protein 2 (MeCP2), at the COX-2 promoter in lung fibroblasts from patients with IPF (F-IPFs) compared with fibroblasts from nonfibrotic lungs.

In IPF lungs, ROCK-II was predominantly expressed by bronchial epithelial cells, as well as at a lower level by airway smooth muscle cells, vascular smooth muscle cells, and the fibroblasts of fibroblastic foci (FF). In addition, there was moderate p-MYPT-1 expression in these cells of IPF lungs.

Many patients need a surgical lung biopsy for the definite diagnosis of IPF but age and the clinical context often contraindicate this procedure. The aim of this study is to identify predictors of survival, apart from lung biopsy, in patients with definite and possible IPF. PATIENTS AND METHODS: We studied 42 patients with HRCT pattern of definite or possible IPF, by assessing the mortality in relationship with baseline HRCT and functional findings. HRCT was assessed both as prevalent pattern (definite vs possible UIP) and as score of the different abnormalities (in particular, honeycombing (HC) and total fibrotic score). Pulmonary function was assessed as baseline FVC, TLC and DLCO values, as well as change over 6 months of follow-up. Both univariate and multivariate analyses were performed in order to detect predictors of mortality. RESULTS: During follow-up, 10 out of 42 patients died. Mortality rate was not different according to the qualitative pattern of fibrosis at HRCT. Among the different HRCT scores, a cut-off of 15% in the HC score differentiated patients with higher mortality rate. A lower baseline FVC, and a greater decrease in pulmonary function after 6 months, were both associated with higher mortality. In a logistic analysis taking in consideration clinical, radiological and functional findings, only baseline FVC and FVC change after 6 months resulted significant predictors of mortality.

The rat models were created using bleomycin. The animals were divided into six groups: model, control, Ephedra alone, Schisandrae alone, combination of Ephedra and Schisandrae, and hydrocortisone alone. The treatments were administered for 28 days. After 7 and 28 days, the rats were sacrificed for pathological morphology examination, microvascular density determination, and angiogenesis-related cytokine examination. The Ephedra and hydrocortisone groups demonstrated significantly reduced alveolitis and pulmonary fibrosis grades compared with the model group (P < 0.05). The number of blood vessels in the Ephedra group was higher than that in the Schisandrae and combination therapy groups. At 7 days, the expression level of endothelin (ET)-1 in the model group was significantly higher than that in the normal group (P < 0.01). The level of 6-keto-prostaglandin F1alpha (6-keto-PGF1alpha) in the treatment group increased, and there were significant differences between the Ephedra group and the combination therapy and normal groups (P < 0.05). Ephedra inhibited the increase in the lung coefficient. The combination therapy prevented pulmonary artery injury and angiogenesis of the arteries by reducing the level of ET-1 and promoting the level of 6-keto-PGF1alpha in the blood. Ephedra and Schisandrae prevented alveolitis and the development of pulmonary fibrosis.',\n",

Communication models used in other conditions that share many challenges with IPF, such as cancer, provide important insights for developing specifically designed patient support and communications models in IPF. Three communication models will be described: 1) the patient-centred care model (for oncology); 2) the three pillars of care model (for IPF); and 3) the Brompton model of care (for interstitial lung disease). Themes common to all three models include comprehensive patient education, encouraged patient participation and an accessible healthcare system, all supported by a collaborative provider-patient relationship.

The amount of elastic fibers (EF) and detailed differences between IPPFE and IPF have not been fully elucidated. The aim of this study was to quantify the EF and identify the differences between IPPFE and IPF. METHODS: We evaluated six patients with IPPFE and 28 patients with IPF who underwent surgical lung biopsy or autopsy. The patients' clinical history, physical findings, chest high-resolution computed tomography (HRCT) findings, and pathological features of lung specimens were retrospectively evaluated. The amounts of EF in lung specimens were quantified with Weigert's staining using a camera with a charge-coupled device and analytic software in both groups. RESULTS: Fewer patients with IPPFE than IPF had fine crackles (50.0% vs. 96.4%, p = 0.012). Patients with IPPFE had a lower forced vital capacity (62.7 +/- 10.9% vs. 88.6 +/- 21.9% predicted, p = 0.009), higher consolidation scores on HRCT (1.7 +/- 0.8 vs. 0.3 +/- 0.5, p < 0.0001), lower body mass indices (17.9 +/- 0.9 vs. 24.3 +/- 2.8, p < 0.0001), and more pneumothoraces than did patients with IPF (66.7 vs. 3.6%, p = 0.002). Lung specimens from patients with IPPFE had more than twice the amount of EF than did those from patients with IPF (28.5 +/- 3.3% vs. 12.1 +/- 4.4%, p < 0.0001). The amount of EF in the lower lobes was significantly lower than that in the upper lobes, even in the same patient with IPPFE (23.6 +/- 2.4% vs. 32.4 +/- 5.5%, p = 0.048). However, the amount of EF in the lower lobes of patients with IPPFE was still higher than that of patients with IPF (23.6 +/- 2.4% vs. 12.2 +/- 4.4%, p < 0.0001). CONCLUSION: More than twice the amount of EF was found in patients with IPPFE than in those with IPF.

       " '24918967': 'RATIONALE: The development of pulmonary hypertension (PH) in patients with idiopathic pulmonary fibrosis (IPF) or chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD) is associated with increased morbidity. OBJECTIVES: To elucidate whether vascular remodeling in a well-characterized PH-COPD and PH-IPF patient cohort results from similar or divergent molecular changes. METHODS: Vascular remodeling of donor, PH-COPD, and PH-IPF pulmonary arteries was assessed. Laser capture microdissected pulmonary artery profiles in combination with whole genome microarrays were performed. MEASUREMENTS AND MAIN RESULTS: Pulmonary arteries from patients with COPD and IPF with PH exhibited remodeling of vascular layers and reduction of lumen area. Pathway analyses comparing normalized gene expression profiles obtained from patients with PH-IPF or PH-COPD revealed the retinol and extracellular matrix (ECM) receptor interaction to be the most perturbed processes. Within the ECM-receptor pathway, differential regulation of 5 out of the top 10 results (collagen, type III, alpha-1; tenascin C; collagen, type VI, alpha-3; thrombospondin 2; and von Willebrand factor) were verified by real-time polymerase chain reaction and immunohistochemical staining. CONCLUSIONS: Despite clinical and histologic vascular remodeling in all patients with PH-COPD and PH-IPF, differential gene expression pattern was present in pulmonary artery profiles. Several genes involved in retinol metabolism and ECM receptor interaction enable discrimination of vascular remodeling in PH-IPF or PH-COPD. This suggests that pulmonary arterial remodeling in PH-COPD and PH-IPF is caused by different molecular mechanisms and may require specific therapeutic options.',\n",
       " '24921217': 'RATIONALE: Wnt/beta-catenin signaling has been implicated in lung fibrosis, but how this occurs and whether expression changes in Wnt pathway components predict disease progression is unknown. OBJECTIVES: To determine whether the Wnt coreceptor Lrp5 drives pulmonary fibrosis in mice and is predictive of disease severity in humans. METHODS: We examined mice with impaired Wnt signaling caused by loss of the Wnt coreceptor Lrp5 in models of lung fibrosis induced by bleomycin or an adenovirus encoding an active form of transforming growth factor (TGF)-beta. We also analyzed gene expression in peripheral blood mononuclear cells (PBMC) from patients with idiopathic pulmonary fibrosis (IPF). MEASUREMENTS AND MAIN RESULTS: In patients with IPF, analysis of peripheral blood mononuclear cells revealed that elevation of positive regulators, Lrp5 and 6, was independently associated with disease progression. LRP5 was also associated with disease severity at presentation in an additional cohort of patients with IPF. Lrp5 null mice were protected against bleomycin-induced pulmonary fibrosis, an effect that was phenocopied by direct inhibition of beta-catenin signaling by the small molecular inhibitor of beta-catenin responsive transcription. Transplantation of Lrp5 null bone marrow cells into wild-type mice did not limit fibrosis. Instead, Lrp5 loss was associated with reduced TGF-beta production by alveolar type 2 cells and leukocytes. Consistent with a role of Lrp5 in the activation of TGF-beta, Lrp5 null mice were not protected against lung fibrosis induced by TGF-beta. CONCLUSIONS: We show that the Wnt coreceptor, Lrp5, is a genetic driver of lung fibrosis in mice and a marker of disease progression and severity in humans with IPF. Evidence that TGF-beta signaling can override a loss in Lrp5 has implications for patient selection and timing of Wnt pathway inhibitors in lung fibrosis.',\n",

We also analyzed PKD activation and function in human lung epithelial cells. We found that PKD family kinases (PKD1, PKD2 and PKD3) were increased and activated in the hyperplastic and regenerative alveolar epithelial cells lining remodeled fibrotic alveolar septa and/or fibroblast foci in IPF lungs compared with normal controls. We also found that PKD family kinases were increased and activated in alveolar macrophages, bronchiolar epithelium, and honeycomb cysts in IPF lungs. Interestingly, PKD1 was highly expressed and activated in the cilia of IPF bronchiolar epithelial cells, while PKD2 and PKD3 were expressed in the cell cytoplasm and nuclei. In contrast, PKD family kinases were not apparently increased and activated in IPF fibroblasts or myofibroblasts. We lastly found that PKD was predominantly activated by poly-L-arginine, lysophosphatidic acid and thrombin in human lung epithelial cells and that PKD promoted epithelial barrier dysfunction.

AIMS: Aim of this proteomic study was to compare broncho alveolar lavage fluid protein profiles of IPF patients, never-smoker healthy control (nonsmoker control) and smoker control subjects in order to investigate proteins potentially related to disease progression and pathogenesis. METHODS: Broncho alveolar lavage fluid samples were resolved using 2D-PAGE and the differentially expressed proteins were identified by MS. The performed PCA statistically proved the correlation existing between differentially expressed spots in the three groups. Functional analysis of the identified proteins was performed by pathway and enrichment analysis by MetaCore and Database for Annotation, Visualization and Integrated Discovery. RESULTS: Interestingly, transcriptional factors NF-kB, PPARgamma, and c-myc emerged as well as a group of functional hubs. Enrichment analysis suggested that Gene Ontology (GO) process networks and pathway maps involved in IPF included angiotensin system maturation, renin-angiotensin-aldosteron system, heme metabolism, coagulation system, response to hypoxia, oxidative stress, and iron transport.

METHODS: Seventy IPF patients with histologically proven lung cancer were identified through a search of the Seoul National University Bundang Hospital database between 2003 and 2012. Of these, 33 patients who had undergone surgery were matched with 66 patients who had lung cancer without IPF. Matched variables included age, sex, histologic type, and lung cancer stage. RESULTS: Of the 70 subjects, 94% were male, and the mean age was 70 years (range, 46-90). In total, 81% of the tumors were located in the lung periphery, and 56% were in the lower lobe. The majority of cancers (70%) were observed in the fibrotic area on chest computed tomography scans. The most frequent histologic type was squamous cell carcinoma (40%). Among surgically treated patients (33 cases and 66 controls), the 5-year survival rates were 38% for lung cancer patients with IPF and 73% for those without IPF (p = 0.001).

Evidence statements from the most recent international guidelines and some historical trial data were also included for context. DATA SYNTHESIS: Numerous treatment options have been evaluated for IPF. Therapies evaluated in large trials have either resulted in increased mortality (anticoagulation, triple-therapy with N-acetylcysteine [NAC], azathioprine, and prednisone) or demonstrated a lack of efficacy (endothelin receptor antagonists, single-agent NAC).

Its pathogenesis is poorly understood. Activated platelets can release pro-fibrotic mediators that have the potential to contribute to lung fibrosis. We determine platelet reactivity in subjects with IPF compared to age-matched controls. METHODS: Whole blood flow cytometry was used to measure platelet-monocyte aggregate formation, platelet P-selectin expression and platelet fibrinogen binding at basal levels and following stimulation with platelet agonists. A plasma swap approach was used to assess the effect of IPF plasma on control platelets. RESULTS: Subjects with IPF showed greater platelet reactivity than controls. Platelet P-selectin expression was significantly greater in IPF patients than controls following stimulation with 0.1 microM ADP (1.9% positive +/-0.5 (mean +/- SEM) versus 0.7%+/-0.1; p = 0.03), 1 microM ADP (9.8%+/-1.3 versus 3.3%+/-0.8; p<0.01) and 10 microM ADP (41.3%+/-4.2 versus 22.5%+/-2.6; p<0.01). Platelet fibrinogen binding was also increased, and platelet activation resulted in increased platelet-monocyte aggregate formation in IPF patients. Re-suspension of control platelets in plasma taken from subjects with IPF resulted in increased platelet activation compared to control plasma.

RESULTS: Significant differences were observed between the ET and the control groups in raw mean deltas (Delta = post- - pre-intervention): Delta6MWD, 81 m, p < 0.001; DeltaVO2 peak, 2.6 ml/kg/min, p = 0.002; Deltawork rate, 22 W, p < 0.001; Deltaanaerobic threshold, 3.1 ml/kg/min, p < 0.001, and DeltaFVC % predicted, 6%, p = 0.038. Dyspnea, QOL and 30-second chair-stand were also improved significantly following the program. CONCLUSIONS: ET improves exercise tolerance, functional capacity, pulmonary function, dyspnea and QOL in patients with IPF, suggesting a short-term treatment efficacy for clinical improvement, and should be considered the standard care for IPF.',\n",

The disease progresses inexorably to chronic respiratory insufficiency, occasionally with episodes of acute exacerbation, and death after a median of 3 years. Treatment with pirfenidone in patients with mild to moderate disease slows the progression of disease, and reduces the risk of death at one year, with skin and gastro-intestinal adverse events.

METHODS: in this cross-sectional study study data were collected on all patients of 18 years of age and older admitted as primary or secondary idiopathic fibrosing alveolitis (ICD9-CM 516.3) to Lazio hospitals, from 1/1/2005 to 31/12/2009, using regional hospital discharge, population and cause of death databases. Reporting accuracy was assessed on a random sample of hospital charts carrying the ICD9-CM 516.3, 516.8, 516.9 and 515 codes, by reviewing radiology and pathology findings to define cases as IPF \"confident\", \"possible\" or \"inconsistent\". RESULTS: Annual prevalence and incidence of IPF were estimated at 25.6 per 100,000 and 7.5 per 100,000 using the ICD9-CM code 516.3 without chart audit while they were estimated at 31.6 per 100,000 and at 9,3 per 100,000 for the IPF \"confident\" definition after hospital chart audit.

In patients with atypical radiologic and clinical features, what specific findings predict underlying IPF vs. CTD-UIP diagnosis and their respective long term survival? METHODS: A large retrospective cohort analysis was done of consecutive patients seen from 1995 through 2010 with biopsy confirmed UIP completed or reviewed at our institution. CTD-UIP was defined by independent rheumatology consultation with exclusion of all other secondary causes of lung fibrosis. Primary clinical data was collected and compared for IPF and CTD-UIP along with logistic regression performed for predictors of disease likelihood and Cox proportional hazards analysis for predictors of survival. RESULTS: Six hundred and twenty five patients were included in the study of which 89 had diagnosed CTD-UIP representing 7 disease entities. Survival was better among those with CTD-UIP except in UIP associated with rheumatoid arthritis, which had similar presenting features and survival to IPF. Predictors of underlying CTD included female gender, younger age, positive autoimmune serology, and inconsistent presenting radiologic findings. Only age and forced vital capacity corrected for a priori covariates were predictive of survival in CTD-UIP. CONCLUSIONS: UIP pathology occurs frequently among patients with atypically presenting clinical and radiologic features, and may represent IPF or CTD-UIP with improved prognosis if underlying CTD is diagnosed. Presenting radiologic and pathologic features alone are not predictive of underlying secondary cause or survival between the two groups.',\n",
       " '25476248': 'BACKGROUND: Idiopathic pulmonary fibrosis is a common and invariably fatal disease with limited therapeutic options. Ca2+-activated KCa3.1 potassium channels play a key role in promoting TGFbeta1 and bFGF-dependent profibrotic responses in human lung myofibroblasts (HLMFs). We hypothesised that KCa3.1 channel-dependent cell processes regulate HLMF alphaSMA expression via Smad2/3 signalling pathways. METHODS: In this study we have compared the phenotype of HLMFs derived from non-fibrotic healthy control lungs (NFC) with cells derived from IPF lungs. HLMFs grown in vitro were examined for alphaSMA expression by immunofluorescence (IF), RT-PCR and flow cytommetry. Basal Smad2/3 signalling was examined by RT-PCR, western blot and immunofluorescence. Two specific and distinct KCa3.1 blockers (TRAM-34 200 nM and ICA-17043 [Senicapoc] 100 nM) were used to determine their effects on HLMF differentiation and the Smad2/3 signalling pathways. RESULTS: IPF-derived HLMFs demonstrated increased constitutive expression of both alpha-smooth muscle actin (alphaSMA) and actin stress fibres, indicative of greater myofibroblast differentiation. This was associated with increased constitutive Smad2/3 mRNA and protein expression, and increased Smad2/3 nuclear localisation. The increased Smad2/3 nuclear localisation was inhibited by removing extracellular Ca2+ or blocking KCa3.1 ion channels with selective KCa3.1 blockers (TRAM-34, ICA-17043). This was accompanied by de-differentiation of IPF-derived HLMFs towards a quiescent fibroblast phenotype as demonstrated by reduced alphaSMA expression and reduced actin stress fibre formation. CONCLUSIONS: Taken together, these data suggest that Ca2+- and KCa3.1-dependent processes facilitate \"constitutive\" Smad2/3 signalling in IPF-derived fibroblasts, and thus promote fibroblast to myofibroblast differentiation. Importantly, inhibiting KCa3.1 channels reverses this process. Targeting KCa3.1 may therefore provide a novel and effective approach for the treatment of IPF and there is the potential for the rapid translation of KCa3.1-directed therapy to the clinic.',\n",

This study was conducted to confirm the association between rs35705950 and IPF in a Japanese population. METHODS: Genomic DNA was extracted from blood samples in 384 Japanese and 137 German subjects, and rs35705950 was detected by commercially available genotyping assay. RESULTS: The genotype distributions of rs35705950 in Japanese patients with IPF, nonspecific interstitial pneumonia (NSIP) and healthy subjects (HS) were significantly different from those in the German counterparts (P < 0.001, P < 0.001 and P = 0.010, respectively).

OBJECTIVE: Goal of this retrospective study was to assess whether the presence of PH in patients with IPF might influence 6MWT performances. METHODS: We retrospectively reviewed the data of patients with IPF who were referred to our hospital. The study population was divided in two groups according to the presence or absence of PH at right heart catheterization; then, the six-minute walking distance (6MWD) and pulmonary function tests (PFTs) were compared between groups. RESULTS: Study population included 30 IPF patients with a mean age of 59.0 years (+/- 8.3), most of whom (76.7%) were males. A total of 43.3% of patients had PH. PFTs data were similar in IPF patients of the two groups; the only exception was FVC, which was significantly higher in IPF patients with PH (63.8% +/- 16.0 vs. 51.6% +/- 13.8 in patients without PH, p<0.05).

Historically, the default therapy for IPF was a combination of prednisone, N-acetylcysteine, and azathioprine, but recent trials have shown that this regimen actually increases mortality. An enormous body of work in recent years, spanning the bench to the bedside, has radically altered our understanding of the molecular mechanisms underlying IPF.

The disease course of IPF is extremely variable, with some patients exhibiting stability of symptoms for prolonged periods of time, whereas others exhibit rapid progression and loss of lung function. Viral infections have been implicated in IPF and linked to disease severity; however, whether they directly contribute to progression is unclear. We previously classified patients as rapid and slow progressors on the basis of clinical features and expression of the pathogen recognition receptor, Toll-like receptor 9 (TLR9). Activation of TLR9 in vivo exacerbated IPF in mice and induced differentiation of myofibroblasts in vitro, but the mechanism of TLR9 up-regulation and progression of fibrosis are unknown. Herein, we investigate whether transforming growth factor (TGF)-beta, a pleiotropic cytokine central to IPF pathogenesis, regulates TLR9 in lung myofibroblasts. Results showed induction of TLR9 expression by TGF-beta in lung myofibroblasts and a distinct profibrotic myofibroblast phenotype driven by stimulation with the TLR9 agonist, CpG-DNA. Chronic TLR9 stimulation resulted in stably differentiated alpha-smooth muscle actin(+)/platelet-derived growth factor receptor alpha(+)/CD44(+)/matrix metalloproteinase-14(+)/matrix metalloproteinase-2(+) myofibroblasts, which secrete inflammatory cytokines, invade Matrigel toward platelet-derived growth factor, and resist hypoxia-induced apoptosis.

OBJECTIVE: To compare outcomes in single- and double-lung transplant recipients since the Lung Allocation Score was implemented. DESIGN, SETTING, AND PARTICIPANTS: In this exploratory analysis, adults with idiopathic pulmonary fibrosis (IPF) or chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD) who underwent lung transplantation in the United States between May 4, 2005, and December 31, 2012, were identified in the United Network for Organ Sharing thoracic registry, with follow-up to December 31, 2012. Posttransplantation graft survival was assessed with Kaplan-Meier analysis. Propensity scores were used to control for treatment selection bias. A multivariable flexible parametric prognostic model was used to characterize the time-varying hazard associated with single- vs double-lung transplantation. EXPOSURE: Single- or double-lung transplantation. MAIN OUTCOMES AND MEASURES: Composite of posttransplant death and graft failure (retransplantation). RESULTS: Patients with IPF (n = 4134, of whom 2010 underwent single-lung and 2124 underwent double-lung transplantation) or COPD (n = 3174, of whom 1299 underwent single-lung and 1875 underwent double-lung transplantation) were identified as having undergone lung transplantation since May 2005. Median follow-up was 23.5 months. Of the patients with IPF, 1380 (33.4%) died and 115 (2.8%) underwent retransplantation; of the patients with COPD, 1138 (34.0%) died and 59 (1.9%) underwent retransplantation. After confounders were controlled for with propensity score analysis, double-lung transplants were associated with better graft survival in patients with IPF (adjusted median survival, 65.2 months [interquartile range {IQR}, 21.4-91.3 months] vs 50.4 months [IQR, 17.0-87.5 months]; P < .001) but not in patients with COPD (adjusted median survival, 67.7 months [IQR, 25.2-89.6 months] vs 64.0 months [IQR, 25.2-88.7 months]; P = .23). The interaction between diagnosis type (COPD or IPF) and graft failure was significant (P = .049). Double-lung transplants had a time-varying association with graft survival; a decreased instantaneous late hazard for death or graft failure among patients with IPF was noted at 1 year and persisted at 5 years postoperatively (instantaneous hazard at 5 years, hazard ratio, 0.67 [95% CI, 0.52-0.84] in patients with IPF and 0.89 [95% CI, 0.71-1.13] in patients with COPD). CONCLUSIONS AND RELEVANCE: In an exploratory analysis of registry data since implementation of a medical need-based lung allocation system, double-lung transplantation was associated with better graft survival than single-lung transplantation in patients with IPF.

Although the pathogenic pathways involved in IPF have not been fully elucidated, IPF is believed to be caused by repetitive alveolar epithelial cell injury and dysregulated repair, in which there is uncontrolled proliferation of lung fibroblasts and differentiation of fibroblasts into myofibroblasts, which excessively deposit extracellular matrix (ECM) proteins in the interstitial space. A number of profibrotic mediators including platelet-derived growth factor (PDGF), fibroblast growth factor (FGF) and transforming growth factor-beta are believed to play important roles in the pathogenesis of IPF. Nintedanib is a potent small molecule inhibitor of the receptor tyrosine kinases PDGF receptor, FGF receptor and vascular endothelial growth factor receptor. Data from in vitro studies have shown that nintedanib interferes with processes active in fibrosis such as fibroblast proliferation, migration and differentiation, and the secretion of ECM. In addition, nintedanib has shown consistent anti-fibrotic and anti-inflammatory activity in animal models of lung fibrosis.

We sought to determine whether the serum periostin levels correlate with overall survival (OS) and time-to-event (TTE), as a parameter reflecting long-term outcome, and with the extent of abnormality on chest high-resolution computed tomography (HRCT) scores in patients with IPF. METHODS: Twenty-nine patients with IPF were analyzed retrospectively. The mean observation period was 1035.2 +/- 663.1 days (range, 112-1800 days). High-resolution computed tomography (HRCT) scores were calculated based on the extent of abnormality evidenced by HRCT. We evaluated if there were any correlations between the serum periostin levels and clinical parameters, including HRCT score, using Spearman's rank correlation coefficients and analyzed predictors of OS and TTE using the log-rank tests. RESULTS: We showed that the serum periostin levels significantly correlated with the increase of honeycombing score on HRCT during a 6-month period. Log-rank tests showed that a higher serum periostin level was a predictor of a shortened OS and TTE. Greater extents of fibrotic lesions on HRCT scan were predictors of shortened OS and TTE.

The main symptoms are shortness of breath and cough, and as the disease progresses there is a considerable impact on day-to-day life. Few treatments are currently available. OBJECTIVES: To conduct a systematic review of clinical effectiveness and an analysis of cost-effectiveness of treatments for IPF based on an economic model informed by systematic reviews of cost-effectiveness and quality of life. DATA SOURCES: Eleven electronic bibliographic databases, including MEDLINE, EMBASE, Web of Science, and The Cochrane Library and the Centre for Reviews and Dissemination databases, were searched from database inception to July 2013. Reference lists of relevant publications were also checked and experts consulted. METHODS: Two reviewers independently screened references for the systematic reviews, extracted and checked data from the included studies and appraised their risk of bias. An advisory group was consulted about the choice of interventions until consensus was reached about eligibility. A narrative review with meta-analysis was undertaken, and a network meta-analysis (NMA) was performed. A decision-analytic Markov model was developed to estimate cost-effectiveness of pharmacological treatments for IPF. Parameter values were obtained from NMA and systematic reviews. Univariate and probabilistic sensitivity analyses were undertaken. The model perspective is NHS and Personal Social Services, and discount rate is 3.5% for costs and health benefits. RESULTS: Fourteen studies were included in the review of clinical effectiveness, of which one evaluated azathioprine, three N-acetylcysteine (NAC) (alone or in combination), four pirfenidone, one BIBF 1120, one sildenafil, one thalidomide, two pulmonary rehabilitation, and one a disease management programme. Study quality was generally good, with a low risk of bias. The current evidence suggests that some treatments appear to be clinically effective. The model base-case results show increased survival for five pharmacological treatments, compared with best supportive care, at increased cost. General recommendations cannot be made of their cost-effectiveness owing to limitations in the evidence base. LIMITATIONS: Few direct comparisons of treatments were identified. An indirect comparison through a NMA was performed; however, caution is recommended in the interpretation of these results. In relation to the economic model, there is an assumption that pharmacological treatments have a constant effect on the relative rate of per cent predicted forced vital capacity decline. CONCLUSIONS: Few interventions have any statistically significant effect on IPF and a lack of studies on palliative care approaches was identified. Research is required into the effects of symptom control interventions, in particular pulmonary rehabilitation and thalidomide.

Peroxisomes are known to be important in ROS and proinflammatory lipid degradation, and their deficiency induces liver fibrosis. However, altered peroxisome functions in IPF pathogenesis have never been investigated. By comparing peroxisome-related protein and gene expression in lung tissue and isolated lung fibroblasts between human control and IPF patients, we found that IPF lungs exhibited a significant down-regulation of peroxisomal biogenesis and metabolism (e.g., PEX13p and acyl-CoA oxidase 1). Moreover, in vivo the bleomycin-induced down-regulation of peroxisomes was abrogated in transforming growth factor beta (TGF-beta) receptor II knockout mice indicating a role for TGF-beta signaling in the regulation of peroxisomes. Furthermore, in vitro treatment of IPF fibroblasts with the profibrotic factors TGF-beta1 or tumor necrosis factor alpha (TNF-alpha) was found to down-regulate peroxisomes via the AP-1 signaling pathway. Therefore, the molecular mechanisms by which reduced peroxisomal functions contribute to enhanced fibrosis were further studied. Direct down-regulation of PEX13 by RNAi induced the activation of Smad-dependent TGF-beta signaling accompanied by increased ROS production and resulted in the release of cytokines (e.g., IL-6, TGF-beta) and excessive production of collagen I and III. In contrast, treatment of fibroblasts with ciprofibrate or WY14643, PPAR-alpha activators, led to peroxisome proliferation and reduced the TGF-beta-induced myofibroblast differentiation and collagen protein in IPF cells. Taken together, our findings suggest that compromised peroxisome activity might play an important role in the molecular pathogenesis of IPF and fibrosis progression, possibly by exacerbating pulmonary inflammation and intensifying the fibrotic response in the patients.',\n",

We believe that addressing these four considerations will encourage and enable investment in this new era of drug development in IPF, and will lead to more rapid development of effective therapies.',\n",
       " '25903793': \"Idiopathic pulmonary fibrosis (IPF) has been gathering interest in recent years and as such this review will focus on the potential contributions that age plays on its onset and prevalence. Environmental stress over time caused by the inhalation of foreign substances results in subsequent damage and repair of lung tissue. This damage prematurely causes a decrease in stem cell differentiation potential. In conjunction with declining proliferation, the correlation between age and general attenuation of the immune system allows for the introduction of viral components such as the Epstein-Barr virus which has been associated with lung injury, a causation which has not yet been investigated. But, regardless of environmental factors, cellular alterations due to, or in correlation with, age could result in the onset or prolonging of IPF. General genetic mutation and epigenetic methylations accumulate over a person's lifespan while miRNA expression changes from birth to adulthood. This collection of alterations over time may cause dysregulation of expressed genetic material which can result in many age-related diseases including pulmonary fibrosis. Such alterations would be prevented by autophagy or cell-mediated apoptosis, but due to age-related dysregulations, these systems function at a diminished capacity. On the cellular level, the end result is an accumulation of dysfunctional organelles with damaged molecules, such as reactive oxygen species, and general genetic and epigenetic alterations resulting in excess generation of fibrous tissue and overall damage to the pulmonary system.\",\n",

DESIGN: A retrospective cohort design using the Korean Health Insurance Review and Assessment Service (HIRA) database spanned the period from January 2008 to December 2012. Patients with ILD and IPF were identified based on the International Classification of Disease-10 (ICD-10) diagnosis and procedure codes. Definition 1 is code J84 (ILD); Definition 2 is code J84 plus high-resolution computed tomography (HRCT), bronchoalveolar lavage (BAL) or lung biopsy; Definition 3 is code J84.1 (ILD with fibrosis); Definition 4 is code J84.1 and HRCT, BAL or lung biopsy; and Definition 5 is code J84.1A (IPF), and was specifically implemented for IPF. RESULTS: The incidence rates of ILD per 100,000 population based on Definitions 1-5 were respectively 48.5, 32.2, 16.2, 11.4 and 1.7. CONCLUSION: The incidence of ILD with fibrosis was approximately 23% of overall ILD incidence. IPF incidence was approximately 10% of the incidence of ILD with fibrosis.

FK506-binding protein 10 (FKBP10) is a collagen chaperone, mutations of which have been indicated in the reduction of extracellular matrix stiffness (e.g., in osteogenesis imperfecta). OBJECTIVES: To assess the expression and function of FKBP10 in IPF. METHODS: We assessed FKBP10 expression in bleomycin-induced lung fibrosis (using quantitative reverse transcriptase-polymerase chain reaction, Western blot, and immunofluorescence), analyzed microarray data from 99 patients with IPF and 43 control subjects from a U.S. cohort, and performed Western blot analysis from 6 patients with IPF and 5 control subjects from a German cohort. Subcellular localization of FKBP10 was assessed by immunofluorescent stainings. The expression and function of FKBP10, as well as its regulation by endoplasmic reticulum stress or transforming growth factor-beta1, was analyzed by small interfering RNA-mediated loss-of-function experiments, quantitative reverse transcriptase-polymerase chain reaction, Western blot, and quantification of secreted collagens in the lung and in primary human lung fibroblasts (phLF). Effects on collagen secretion were compared with those of the drugs nintedanib and pirfenidone, recently approved for IPF. MEASUREMENTS AND MAIN RESULTS: FKBP10 expression was up-regulated in bleomycin-induced lung fibrosis and IPF. Immunofluorescent stainings demonstrated localization to interstitial (myo)fibroblasts and CD68(+) macrophages. Transforming growth factor-beta1, but not endoplasmic reticulum stress, induced FKBP10 expression in phLF. The small interfering RNA-mediated knockdown of FKBP10 attenuated expression of profibrotic mediators and effectors, including collagens I and V and alpha-smooth muscle actin, on the transcript and protein level. Importantly, loss of FKBP10 expression significantly suppressed collagen secretion by phLF. CONCLUSIONS: FKBP10 might be a novel drug target for IPF.',\n",

       " '26132817': 'PURPOSE OF REVIEW: In this article, we summarize and discuss the most recent literature on personalized medicine in idiopathic pulmonary fibrosis (IPF), a chronic progressive and almost invariably lethal disease of unknown cause. This review is timely as major advances in our understanding of disease pathobiology and improvements in molecular techniques have recently led to the identification of potential surrogates of diagnosis, prognosis and response to treatment. RECENT FINDINGS: The most promising and advanced candidate biomarkers are presented based on their proposed mechanistic pathways (e.g. alveolar epithelial cell dysfunction, immune dysregulation, microbiome, extracellular matrix remodeling and fibroproliferation, epigenetic markers and metabolomics). Recent data suggest that components of the immune system may contribute to the development of IPF. A potential role for infections as a cofactor in disease development and progression or as a trigger in disease exacerbation has also recently been proposed. SUMMARY: Clinical management of IPF is unsatisfactory because of limited availability of truly effective therapies, lack of accurate predictors of disease behavior and absence of simple short-term measures of therapeutic response. A number of putative biomarkers have been identified in patients with IPF, although none has been validated to the standard necessary for their use in either therapeutic trials or clinical practice. Currently, ongoing prospective longitudinal studies will hopefully permit such validation.',\n",
       " '26138239': 'BACKGROUND: Recent clinical studies show that tyrosine kinase inhibitors slow the rate of lung function decline and decrease the number of acute exacerbations in patients with Idiopathic Pulmonary Fibrosis (IPF). However, in the murine bleomycin model of fibrosis, not all tyrosine kinase signaling is detrimental. Exogenous ligands Fibroblast Growth Factor (FGF) 7 and 10 improve murine lung repair and increase survival after injury via tyrosine kinase FGF receptor 2b-signaling. Therefore, the level and location of FGF/FGFR expression as well as the exogenous effect of the most highly expressed FGFR2b ligand, FGF1, was analyzed on human lung fibroblasts. METHODS: FGF ligand and receptor expression was evaluated in donor and IPF whole lung homogenates using western blotting and qPCR. Immunohistochemistry for FGF1 and FGFR1/2/3/4 were performed on human lung tissue. Lastly, the effects of FGF1, a potent, multi-FGFR ligand, were studied on primary cultures of IPF and non-IPF donor fibroblasts. Western blots for pro-fibrotic markers, proliferation, FACS for apoptosis, transwell assays and MetaMorph analyses on cell cultures were performed. RESULTS: Whole lung homogenate analyses revealed decreased FGFR b-isoform expression, and an increase in FGFR c-isoform expression. Of the FGFR2b-ligands, FGF1 was the most significantly increased in IPF patients; downstream targets of FGF-signaling, p-ERK1/2 and p-AKT were also increased. Immunohistochemistry revealed FGF1 co-localization within basal cell sheets, myofibroblast foci, and Surfactant protein-C positive alveolar epithelial type-II cells as well as co-localization with FGFR1, FGFR2, FGFR3, FGFR4 and myofibroblasts expressing the migratory marker Fascin. Both alone and in the presence of heparin, FGF1 led to increased MAPK-signaling in primary lung fibroblasts. While smooth muscle actin was unchanged, heparin + FGF1 decreased collagen production in IPF fibroblasts. In addition, FGF1 + heparin increased apoptosis and cell migration. The FGFR inhibitor (PD173074) attenuated these effects. CONCLUSIONS: Strong expression of FGF1/FGFRs in pathogenic regions of IPF suggest that aberrant FGF1-FGFR signaling is increased in IPF patients and may contribute to the pathogenesis of lung fibrosis by supporting fibroblast migration and increased MAPK-signaling.',\n",

Making an accurate diagnosis of IPF is critical, as it remains only one of many potential diagnoses for an elderly patient with newly recognized interstitial lung disease. Optimal management of IPF, especially in older-aged patients, hinges on such factors as balancing the application of standard-of-care measures with the patient's overall health status (robustness vs frailty) and considering the patient's wishes, desires, and expectations. IPF is known to be associated with certain comorbidities that tend to be more prevalent in the elderly population. Until recently, options for the pharmacologic management of IPF were limited and included therapies such as immunosuppressive agents, which may pose substantial risk to the elderly patient. However, the antifibrotic agents pirfenidone and nintedanib have now become commercially available in the United States for the treatment of IPF. The monitoring and treatment of patients with IPF, especially elderly patients with comorbid medical conditions, require consideration of adverse side effects, the avoidance of potential drug-drug interactions, treatment of comorbidities, and the timely implementation of supportive and palliative measures. Individualized counseling to guide decision-making and enhance quality of life is also integral to optimal management of the elderly patient with IPF.\",\n",

We hypothesized that pulmonary infection can be excluded based on clinical and laboratory data and that bronchoscopy with BAL is not mandatory in the diagnostic work-up of suspected AEX-IPF. METHODS: In this retrospective study we identified patients with acute respiratory failure who were evaluated for AEX-IPF at the Cleveland Clinic between January 2002 and December 2011. Univariate and multivariate analysis were performed with predefined risk factors and final diagnosis of AEX-IPF and pulmonary infection. All tests were performed at a significance level of 0.05. RESULTS: A total of 77 patients met the study inclusion criteria. Of these patients 47 (61 %) were diagnosed with AEX-IPF. Bronchoscopy was more likely to be performed in patients who were on cytotoxic medications (p < 0.05). In most cases the diagnosis of AEX-IPF versus pulmonary infection was based on combination of other microbiological, clinical, radiologic data and clinical judgment. A total of 10 patients out of 14 (71 %) with a final diagnosis of pulmonary infection were on steroids on admission versus 21 out of 63 patients (33 %) with other final diagnosis (p = 0.024, OR 7.817, 95 % CI 1.31-46.64). CONCLUSIONS: Exclusion of infection in our IPF patient cohort was mostly based on factors other than diagnostic bronchoscopy with BAL.

       " '26165208': 'Alveolar epithelial cell loss and impaired epithelial cell regeneration are currently accepted as central initiating events in idiopathic pulmonary fibrosis (IPF), but subsequent downstream effects remain uncertain. The most accepted downstream effect is aberrant and dysregulated mesenchymal cell proliferation and excess extracellular matrix (ECM) accumulation. However, biochemical and imaging studies have perhaps somewhat surprisingly indicated little increase in total lung collagen and lung tissue, and have rather shown a substantial decrease in lung aeration and lung air volume. Loss of tissue aeration is a consequence of alveolar collapse, which occurs in IPF as a result of apposition and septal incorporation of denuded basal lamina. Permanent alveolar collapse is well-documented following epithelial injury, has the ability to mimic interstitial fibrosis radiologically and histologically, and is a better supported explanation than dysregulated fibroblast proliferation and excess ECM accumulation for the constellation of findings in patients with IPF.',\n",
       " '26168886': 'Idiopathic pulmonary fibrosis (IPF) is an interstitial lung disease (ILD) characterized by inflammation and progressive scarring of the lung parenchyma. IPF profoundly affects the quality of life (QoL) and fatigue is a frequently disabling symptom. The cause of fatigue is not well understood but patients with IPF often report extremely poor sleep quality and sleep-related breathing disorders (SRBD) that correlate with QoL. IPF patients present alterations in sleep architecture, including decreased sleep efficiency, slow wave sleep and rapid eye movement (REM) sleep, and increased sleep fragmentation. Moreover, sleep related hypoventilation during the vulnerable REM sleep period and obstructive sleep apnea-hypopnea syndrome (OSAHS) are frequent, but remain usually underdiagnosed. These SRBD in IPF are associated with alterations of the sleep structure, reduction of QoL and increased risk of mortality. In the absence of an effective therapy for IPF, optimizing the QoL could become the primary therapeutic goal. In this perspective the diagnosis and treatment of SRBD could significantly improve the QoL of IPF patients.',\n",

We performed this study to determine which type of transplant is more appropriate for older patients with this condition. METHODS: We conducted a review of the United Network for Organ Sharing database from 2005 to 2013 for patients aged 65 years or more with idiopathic pulmonary fibrosis. A 1:1 nearest-neighbor propensity match was utilized to determine differences in survival by transplant procedure type (SOLT versus BOLT). Logistic regression modeling taking into account interaction terms between prespecified variables and the type of transplant was utilized to determine variables that altered the survival outcomes associated with SOLT versus BOLT. RESULTS: Of 1,564 patients who met study criteria, 521 (33.3%) received BOLT. After propensity matching 498 BOLT recipients to 498 SOLT recipients, BOLT was associated with a significantly improved 5-year survival (48.7% versus 35.2%, p < 0.01). However, the mortality hazard associated with BOLT varied from a nonsignificant reduction in survival within 3 months after transplant (hazard ratio 1.24, 95% confidence interval: 0.80 to 1.93) to a significant survival benefit for patients who survived beyond 1 year (hazard ratio 0.64, 95% confidence interval: 0.47 to 0.86). Functional status was also found to be a significant predictor of the survival benefit associated with BOLT. CONCLUSIONS: Bilateral orthotopic lung transplantation is associated with significantly improved survival over SOLT for older patients with idiopathic pulmonary fibrosis, driven by a late survival benefit from bilateral transplantation. However, patients with a reduced preoperative functional status do not appear to derive a similar benefit from bilateral transplantation.',\n",

AE-IPF has previously been defined based on clinical and radiological features that include the subacute onset of dyspnoea, bilateral ground glass changes on chest high-resolution computed tomography, and the absence of an identifiable aetiology. The annual incidence of AE-IPF is typically reported at 5-15%, but is less common in mild disease. Features of diffuse alveolar damage are present when a biopsy is performed. Idiopathic pulmonary fibrosis (IPF) patients with acute respiratory worsening are often initially treated with high dose corticosteroids and antimicrobials; however, there are no clear data to support these therapies, and the short-term mortality of AE-IPF is ~50%. Recent studies have shown that the features and prognosis of AE-IPF are similar to other causes of acute respiratory worsening, including infection, aspiration, air pollution and mechanical injury to the alveolar epithelium. Based on this emerging evidence, we propose a novel approach to the classification of acute respiratory worsening events in patients with IPF that focuses on clinical and radiological findings consistent with an underlying pathobiology of diffuse alveolar damage.',\n",

METHODS: Ten patients with IPF had received inhaled IFN-gamma (Actimmune, InterMune) for 80 weeks. Full PFTs were available 20-50 weeks before Rx and monthly during Rx. Eighty-nine observations were used in the analysis. Linear mixed models for modeling longitudinal data were used to test if the PFT change over time was significantly different before and after IFN-gamma. Autoregressive dependence structure with order one was consistently selected as the best one to model the intra-patient correlation over time. Normality assumption was confirmed. Significance level was set at 0.05. Using published literature and our data we performed a sample size calculation based on simulated data. RESULTS: The change over time in DLCO was significantly different before and after IFN-gamma treatment. DLCO decreased over time before treatment but increased after treatment (p-value=0.03). Changes in TLC, FRC, RV and FVC were not statistically significant. With a sample size of 60, a placebo controlled, randomized trial has about 90% power to detect a significant difference in the change rate of DLCO in the groups of patients treated with IFN-gamma vs placebo. CONCLUSIONS: DLCO was significantly improved following inhaled (IFN-gamma) as treatment for IPF. Our data suggest that previous studies utilizing parenteral IFN-gamma may have failed because of the mode of delivery. Future randomized, controlled, phase 3 trials, comparing the difference in PFT behavior (specifically DLCO) longitudinally may be more sensitive to drug effect and serve as a valuable clinical endpoint.',\n",

However, the role of PTEN in phenotypic transformation of lung fibroblasts, particularly in the migratory and invasive phenotype, is still elusive. Our data showed that PTEN expression was markedly reduced in both fibroblasts and myofibroblasts from IPF patients. Furthermore, loss of PTEN led to the transformation of normal fibroblasts to myofibroblasts and increased proliferation, apoptosis resistance, and migration/invasion activities. PTEN deficiency upregulated hyaluronan synthase 2 expression and thereby enhanced the invasion ability of fibroblasts.

Currently clinicians and researchers apply a panel of functional, radiological and histopathological indices to stratify patients into distinct phenotypic patterns of disease progression. However, none of these indicators can reliably predict not only treatment responsiveness but more importantly disease behavior, thus allowing clinicians to promptly apply aggressive therapeutic approaches to prevent or ameliorate acute exacerbation. Furthermore, on the contrary to molecular biomarkers, physiologic prognosticators provide no insights into disease mechanism and thus are unlikely to identify distinct molecular phenotypes of the disease.

Patients were randomised to carlumab (1 mg.kg(-1), 5 mg.kg(-1), or 15 mg.kg(-1)) or placebo every 4 weeks. The primary endpoint was the rate of percentage change in forced vital capacity (FVC). Secondary endpoints were time to disease progression, absolute change in FVC, relative change in diffusing capacity of the lung for carbon monoxide (DLCO), and St George's Respiratory Questionnaire (SGRQ) total score.Due to a pre-planned, unfavourable interim benefit-risk analysis, dosing was suspended. The rate of percentage change in FVC showed no treatment effect (placebo -0.582%, 1 mg.kg(-1) -0.533%, 5 mg.kg(-1) -0.799% and 15 mg.kg(-1) -0.470%; p=0.261). All active treatment groups showed a greater decline in FVC (1 mg.kg(-1) -290 mL, 5 mg.kg(-1) -370 mL and 15 mg.kg(-1) -320 mL) compared with placebo (-130 mL). No effect on disease progression, DLCO, infection rates or mortality was observed. SGRQ scores showed a nonsignificant trend toward worsening with active treatment. Unexpectedly, free CC-chemokine ligand 2 levels were elevated above baseline at both 24 and 52 weeks.

Fibroblast activation in IPF is associated with Wnt/beta-catenin signaling, but little is known about the role of the beta-catenin-homologous desmosomal protein, plakoglobin (PG), in IPF. The objective of this study was to assess the functional role of PG in human lung fibroblasts in IPF. METHODS: Human lung fibroblasts from normal or IPF patients were transfected with siRNA targeting PG and used to assess cellular adhesion to a fibronectin substrate, apoptosis and proliferation. Statistical analysis was performed using Student's t-test with Mann-Whitney post-hoc analyses and results were considered significant when p < 0.05. RESULTS: We found that IPF lung fibroblasts expressed less PG protein than control fibroblasts, but that characteristic fibroblast phenotypes (adhesion, proliferation, and apoptosis) were not controlled by PG expression. Consistent with this, normal fibroblasts in which PG was silenced displayed no change in functional phenotype. CONCLUSIONS: We conclude that diminished PG levels in IPF lung fibroblasts do not directly affect certain phenotypic behaviors. Further study is needed to identify the functional consequences of decreased PG in these cells.\",\n",

The participants in this multicenter prospective study were 80 patients (65 men, 15 women) with idiopathic pulmonary fibrosis. Their mean age was 70.6 years. Computed tomography (CT) images were obtained by four different scanners set at different exposures. We measured the extent of fibrosis using GHNC, and used Pearson's correlation analysis, Bland-Altman plots, and kappa analysis to directly compare the GHNC results with manual scoring by radiologists. Multiple linear regression analysis was performed to determine the association between the CT data and forced vital capacity (FVC). RESULTS: For each scanner, the extent of fibrosis as determined by GHNC was significantly correlated with the radiologists' score. In multivariate analysis, the extent of fibrosis as determined by GHNC was significantly correlated with FVC (p < 0.001). There was no significant difference between the results obtained using different CT scanners.

This likely reflects that fact that IPF acute exacerbations are defined clinically as \"noninfectious,\" and little attention has been paid to the outcomes of patients with IPF with diagnosed infections. However, accumulating evidence suggests that infections (both bacterial and viral) may influence disease outcomes either as exacerbating agents or initiators of disease. Support for a viral role in disease initiation comes from studies demonstrating the presence of herpesviral DNA and epithelial cell stress in the lungs of asymptomatic relatives at risk for developing familial IPF. In addition, the number of studies that can associate viral (especially herpesviral) signatures in the lung with the development of IPF is steadily growing, and activated leukocyte signatures in patients with IPF provide further support for infectious processes driving IPF progression. Animal modeling has been used to better understand how a gamma herpesvirus infection can modulate the pathogenesis of lung fibrosis and has demonstrated that preceding infections appear to reprogram lung epithelial cells during latency to produce profibrotic factors, making the lung more susceptible to subsequent fibrotic insult, whereas exacerbations of existing fibrosis, or infections in susceptible hosts, involve active viral replication and are influenced by antiviral therapy. In addition, there is new evidence that bacterial burden in the lungs of patients with IPF may predict a poor prognosis.',\n",

METHODS: Thirty-one participants with IPF and 17 matched healthy controls underwent lung function testing, followed by a 2-min period of resting tidal breathing. The IPF cohort was stratified according to disease severity, based on their forced vital capacity and diffusion capacity for carbon monoxide. RESULTS: In comparison to the healthy controls, the IPF cohort showed a higher tidal volume, VT , of 0.22 L (P = 0.026) and a raised minute ventilation in the severest IPF group, while no differences in the timing of inspiration or expiration were observed. In the IPF cohort, the ratio of VT to forced vital capacity was around 15% higher. These changes corresponded with an increase in the self-reported sensation of breathlessness.

Guidelines recommend high-dose steroids treatment despite unproven benefit. We hypothesized that previous immunosuppression and the administration of high-dose steroids adversely affect IPF-AE outcome. METHODS: We studied all consecutive patients hospitalized in our department for IPF deterioration from 2007 to June 2013. Our protocol consisted of immediate cessation of immunosuppression (if any), best supportive care, broad-spectrum antimicrobials and thorough evaluation to detect reversible causes of deterioration. Patients were followed-up for survival; post-discharge none received immunosuppression. RESULTS: Twenty-four out of 85 admissions (28%) fulfilled IPF-AE criteria. IPF-AE were analyzed both as unique events and as unique patients. As unique events 50% survived; 3 out of 12 (25%) in the group previously treated with immunosuppression whereas nine out of 12 (75%) in the group not receiving immunosuppression (p = 0.041). As unique patients 35.3% survived; 3 out of 6 (50%) in the never treated group whereas three out of 11 (27.3%) in the group receiving immunosuppression (p = 0.685). The history of immunosuppression significantly and adversely influenced survival (p = 0.035). Survival was greater in the never treated group compared to the immunosuppressed patients (p = 0.022). Post-discharge, our IPF-AE survivors had an 83% 1-year survival. CONCLUSIONS: By applying the above mentioned protocol half of our patients survived.

This study examined change in forced vital capacity (FVC) across IPF patients in the 6 months after diagnosis and its association with clinical and healthcare resource utilization (HRU) outcomes in a real-world setting in the U.S. METHODS: A retrospective chart review was conducted of patients diagnosed with IPF by U.S. pulmonologists. Patient eligibility criteria included: 1) 40 years or older with a confirmed date of first IPF diagnosis with high-resolution computed tomography and/or lung biopsy between 01/2011 and 06/2013; 2) FVC results recorded at first diagnosis (+/-1 month) and at 6 months (+/-3 months) following diagnosis. Based on relative change in FVC percent predicted (FVC%), patients were categorized as stable (decline <5%), marginal decline (decline >/=5% and <10%), or significant decline (decline >/=10%). Physician-reported clinical and HRU outcomes were assessed from ~6 months post-diagnosis until the last contact date with the physician and compared between FVC% change groups. Multivariable Cox proportional-hazards models were constructed to assess risk of mortality, suspected acute exacerbation (AEx), and hospitalization post-FVC% change. Generalized estimating equations were used to account for multiple patients contributed by individual physicians. RESULTS: The sample included 490 IPF patients contributed by 168 pulmonologists. The mean (SD) age was 61 (11) years, 68% were male, and the mean (SD) baseline FVC% was 60% (26%). 250 (51%) patients were categorized as stable, 98 (20%) as marginal decline, and 142 (29%) as significant decline. The mean (SD) observation time was 583 (287) days. In both unadjusted analysis and multivariable models, significantly worse clinical outcomes and increased HRU were observed with greater lung-function decline. CONCLUSIONS: These findings suggest that nearly half of IPF patients experienced decline in FVC% within ~6 months following IPF diagnosis. Greater FVC% decline was associated with an increased risk of further IPF progression, suspected AEx, mortality, and higher rate of HRU. Management options that slow FVC decline may help improve future health outcomes in IPF.',\n",

METHODS: Patients from the UK, Germany and Italy, with a diagnosis of IPF (duration >3 months), who were being treated with pirfenidone, were recruited from patient support groups, specialist centres and advocacy groups. Semi-structured, qualitative, in-depth patient interviews of 1-h duration were conducted by an independent researcher. Patients were initially asked about their experiences of living with IPF and then prompted to describe their experiences of taking pirfenidone. Techniques utilised included: the bubble-speech technique; the icon cards projective exercise; and the free association exercise. All interviews were transcribed and analysed by an independent researcher. RESULTS: Forty-five patients (71% male) were interviewed (mean age 68.5 years; mean time since diagnosis 3.5 years); 87% of patients reported that diagnosis took >1 year. Patients reported that IPF had a significant physical and emotional impact on their quality of life. The beneficial role played by caregivers and interstitial lung disease specialist nurses (where available) was specifically highlighted. Although most patients were keen for information on IPF, this was often of poor quality, out of date, or in English only.

We searched MEDLINE and EMBASE for randomized controlled trials (RCTs) up to August 2015. The Grading of Recommendations Assessment, Development and Evaluation (GRADE) approach served to assess the certainty in the evidence of direct and indirect estimates. We calculated the surface under the cumulative ranking curve (SUCRA) for each treatment. We included parallel group RCTs, including factorial designs, but excluded quasi-randomized and cross-over trials. Studies were only included if they involved adult (>/=18 years of age) patients with IPF as defined by the 2011 criteria and examined one of the 10 interventions of interest (ambrisentan, bosentan, imatinib, macitentan, N-acetylcysteine, nintedanib, pirfenidone, sildenafil, prednisone/azathioprine/N-acetylcysteine triple therapy, and vitamin K antagonist). RESULTS: A total of 19 RCTs (5,694 patients) comparing 10 different interventions with placebo and an average follow-up period of 1 year fulfilled the inclusion criteria. SUCRA analysis suggests nintedanib, pirfenidone, and sildenafil are the three treatments with the highest probability of reducing mortality in IPF. Indirect comparison showed no significant difference in mortality between pirfenidone and nintedanib (NMA OR, 1.05; 95% CrI, 0.45-2.78, moderate certainty of evidence), pirenidone and sildenafil (NMA OR, 2.26; 95% CrI, 0.44-13.17, low certainty of evidence), or nintedanib and sildenafil (NMA OR 2.40; 95% CrI, 0.47-14.66, low certainty of evidence).

Recently two drugs, pirfenidone and nintedanib, were approved for clinical use as they are able to slow down the disease progression. The mechanisms by which these two drugs act in in vitro cell systems are not known. The aim of this study was therefore to examine the effects of pirfenidone and nintedanib on fibroblasts and myofibroblasts structure and function established from patients with or without IPF. METHODS: Stromal cells were collected and cultured from control lung (n = 4) or IPF (n = 7). The cells were treated with pirfenidone and/or nintedanib and the effect of treatment was evaluated by measuring cell proliferation, alpha smooth muscle actin (alpha-SMA) and fibronectin expression by Western analysis and/or immunoelectron microscopy, ultrastructural properties by transmission electron microscopy and functional properties by collagen gel contraction and invasion assays. RESULTS: Both pirfenidone and nintedanib reduced in vitro proliferation of fibroblastic cells in a dose dependent manner. The number of cells from control lung was reduced to 47 % (p = 0.04) and of IPF cells to 42 % (p = 0.04) by 1 mM pirfenidone and correspondingly to 67 % (p = 0.04) and 68 % (p = 0.04), by 1 muM nintedanib. If both drugs were used together, a further reduced proliferation was observed. Both pirfenidone and nintedanib were able to reduce the amount of alpha-SMA and the myofibroblastic appearance although the level of reduction was cell line dependent. In functional assays, the effect of both drugs was also variable. CONCLUSIONS: We conclude that the ultrastructure and function of fibroblasts and myofibroblasts are affected by pirfenidone and nintedanib. Combination of the drugs reduced cell proliferation more than either of them individually. Human lung derived cell culture systems represent a potential platform for screening and testing drugs for fibrotic diseases.',\n",

To determine the effects of PTEN on the development of pulmonary fibrosis, PTEN was overexpressed in transforming growth factor (TGF)beta1treated human embryonic lung fibroblasts (HFLI cells). The serum levels of PTEN were significantly lower in 42 patients with IPF, as compared with in the healthy controls. In addition, PTEN overexpression enhanced apoptosis, and suppressed basal levels of proliferation and migration in fibroblasts. Notably, PTEN was able to specifically inhibit TGFbeta1induced proliferation and migration of the cells. Overexpression of PTEN also suppressed phosphorylation of Akt and Smad3, and decreased the expression levels of numerous proteins with critical roles in TGFbeta1induced fibrosis, including alphasmooth muscle actin, matrix metalloproteinase (MMP)2 and MMP9.

The incidence age of the 7 subjects (4 males and 3 females) ranged from 30 to 57 years. The propositus was II-4, while the first person attacked by FIPF was I-1. Five patients (2 males, 3 females) in the second generation and one case in the third generation were found at the time of this study. The genetic characteristics of FIPF in this study were complied with the pattern of autosomal dominant inheritance. Imaging examinations and pulmonary function tests were conducted to confirm the diagnosis of pulmonary fibrosis. Meanwhile, personal information and clinical data such as imaging examinations and pathological tests were acquired; clinical features and manifestations were analyzed and compared; and pathological tests and gene detection were performed. RESULTS: The average survival time was 3 years, and poor response to glucocorticoid treatment was observed. Three patients had detailed clinical information, whose interstitial pneumonia related immunologic tests were negative. Concerning pulmonary function, three patients had significant decrease of diffusion function and obvious restrictive ventilatory disorder, with DLCO value as 50%, 23% and 46%, respectively.

Twenty five patients (17.4%, 25/144) met the diagnostic criteria of IPF by the old guideline.While by the revised guideline, 53 patients (36.8%, 53/144) were diagnosed as classical IPF, 29 patients(20.1%, 29/144) as probable cases, another 69 non-IPF patients accounting for 43.1% (62/144). The result revealed that there's a significant difference between the two guidelines in the diagnosis of IPF. CONCLUSIONS: The revised guideline favors an early diagnosis of IPF and simplifies the diagnostic process.However the possibility of over diagnosis or missed diagnosis by the revised guideline does exist.On the other hand, despite of the delayed diagnosis by the old guideline, it may reduce the misdiagnosis of IPF in some circumstance.\",\n",

       " '26906287': 'Idiopathic pulmonary fibrosis is a rare interstitial lung disease included in the Idiopathic Interstitial Pneumonias group. Although several potential risk factors have been described, it is a progressive fibrosing disease of unknown cause affecting mainly adults over 50 years and associated with a poor prognosis, reflected in a median survival of 2-3 years after diagnosis. The concept of a multidisciplinary working group for the diagnosis of idiopathic pulmonary fibrosis is based on the need to have experienced pulmonologists, radiologists and pathologists in the evaluation and correct treatment of the disease, and requires the use of all available data about individual patients, standardized (largely through High Resolution Computed Tomography and pathology when needed) as well as non-standardized data (laboratory, serology and biomarkers). This approach helps to increase diagnostic accuracy and is an internationally accepted recommendation. In regard to therapy, the situation has changed radically since the publication of the ATS/ERS/JRS/ALAT 2011 guidelines on the diagnosis and management of idiopathic pulmonary fibrosis where it was stressed that no proven therapy exists for this disease. Currently besides non-pharmacological treatment, therapy of complications and comorbidities and palliative care, nintedanib and pirfenidone, two compounds with pleiotropic mechanisms of action, are to date, the two drugs with confirmed efficacy in slowing functional decline and disease progression in idiopathic pulmonary fibrosis patients.',\n",

This study investigated the clinical efficacy and safety of long-term pirfenidone use for idiopathic pulmonary fibrosis (IPF) in clinical practice. METHODS: This survey study was a retrospective observational study. A survey was used to collect clinical information on IPF cases that were treated with pirfenidone. This survey sheet came from physicians belonging to the Diffuse Lung Diseases Research Group. RESULTS: 502 patients at 22 institutes received pirfeidone treatment. Of the 502 cases, pirfenidone treatment was terminated in under one year in 186 cases (37.1%); adverse effect was the most frequent reason for termination. The pirfenidone treatment lasted for two years or longer in 111 cases (22.1%). The mean change in the forced vital capacity (FVC) was -30+/-224 (SD) mL in the first year of treatment, -158+/-258 mL in the second year, and -201+/-367 mL in the third year. FVC improved by 10% or more in the first year in 10 (14.7%) of 68 cases, and showed a change of +/-10% in 47 (69.1%) cases. It showed a change of +/-10% in the second and third years in 61.7% and 62.5% of the patients, respectively. CONCLUSION: The FVC improved in only a small percentage of patients who received pirfenidone treatment for a long period of time. However, a decrease in the FVC was prevented for three years in over half of the cases.',\n",
       " '26940352': 'BACKGROUND: Nintedanib is a multi-target receptor tyrosine kinase inhibitor. In two recent randomized phase 3 trials (INPULSIS-1 and -2), it has been shown to slow the disease progression of idiopathic pulmonary fibrosis (IPF) by reducing the decline in the forced vital capacity (FVC). Although the INPULSIS trials indicate that nintedanib may serve to prevent acute exacerbations or delay the time to the first acute exacerbation, a certain number of IPF patients develop acute exacerbations while receiving nintedanib. However, there has been no report on the readministration of nintedanib in IPF patients who develop acute exacerbations during initial treatment with nintedanib. CASE PRESENTATION: A 64-year-old man with IPF had nintedanib added to his ongoing pirfenidone therapy. He developed dyspnea after 65 days and presented with hypoxemia after 68 days. At presentation, chest computed tomography showed newly developed diffuse ground glass opacities with the pre-existing subpleural reticular shadows. Because of the absence of infection or other potential causative factors, we diagnosed an acute exacerbation of IPF. Nintedanib was temporarily discontinued and the acute exacerbation was successfully managed with intensive treatment. We re-initiated nintedanib 30 days after cessation, which helped stabilize his FVC for 8 months. Nintedanib was safely continued for 28 months until he died of a bacterial infection. CONCLUSION: To the best of our our knowledge, this is the first reported case of an acute exacerbation of IPF during nintedanib treatment, wherein nintedanib was safely and successfully restarted after treatment of the acute exacerbation. Our case indicates that nintedanib can be safely resumed and a desired effect on FVC can be obtained, even in IPF patients who develop acute exacerbations. However, we recommend close monitoring and appropriate measures until the long-term safety profile is clarified.',\n",
       " '26944412': 'Idiopathic pulmonary fibrosis (IPF) is a progressive and devastating lung disorder of unknown origin, with very poor prognosis and no effective treatment. The disease is characterized by abnormal activation of alveolar epithelial cells, which secrete numerous mediators involved in the expansion of the fibroblast population, its differentiation to myofibroblasts, and in the exaggerated accumulation of extracellular matrix provoking the loss of lung architecture. Among the excessively produced mediators are several matrix metalloproteases (MMPs) which may contribute to modify the lung microenvironment by various mechanisms. Thus, these enzymes can not only degrade all the components of the extracellular matrix, but they are also able to release, cleave and activate a wide range of growth factors, cytokines, chemokines and cell surface receptors affecting numerous cell functions including adhesion, proliferation, differentiation, recruiting and transmigration, and apoptosis. Therefore, dysregulated expression of MMPs may have profound impact on the biopathological mechanisms implicated in the development of IPF. This review focuses on the current and emerging evidence regarding the role of MMPs on the fibrotic processes in IPF as well as in mouse models of lung fibrosis.',\n",
       " '27031615': 'BACKGROUND: Although several computer-aided computed tomography (CT) analysis methods have been reported to objectively assess the disease severity and progression of idiopathic pulmonary fibrosis (IPF), it is unclear which method is most practical. A universal severity classification system has not yet been adopted for IPF. OBJECTIVE: The purpose of this study was to test the correlation between quantitative-CT indices and lung physiology variables and to determine the ability of such indices to predict disease severity in IPF. METHODS: A total of 27 IPF patients showing radiological UIP pattern on high-resolution (HR) CT were retrospectively enrolled. Staging of IPF was performed according to two classification systems: the Japanese and GAP (gender, age, and physiology) staging systems. CT images were assessed using a commercially available CT imaging analysis workstation, and the whole-lung mean CT value (MCT), the normally attenuated lung volume as defined from -950 HU to -701 Hounsfield unit (NL), the volume of the whole lung (WL), and the percentage of NL to WL (NL%), were calculated. RESULTS: CT indices (MCT, WL, and NL) closely correlated with lung physiology variables. Among them, NL strongly correlated with forced vital capacity (FVC) (r = 0.92, P <0.0001). NL% showed a large area under the receiver operating characteristic curve for detecting patients in the moderate or advanced stages of IPF. Multivariable logistic regression analyses showed that NL% is significantly more useful than the percentages of predicted FVC and predicted diffusing capacity of the lungs for carbon monoxide (Japanese stage II/III/IV [odds ratio, 0.73; 95% confidence intervals (CI), 0.48 to 0.92; P < 0.01]; III/IV [odds ratio. 0.80; 95% CI 0.59 to 0.96; P < 0.01]; GAP stage II/III [odds ratio, 0.79; 95% CI, 0.56 to 0.97; P < 0.05]). CONCLUSION: The measurement of NL% by threshold-based volumetric CT analysis may help improve IPF staging.',\n",

       " '27083934': 'Idiopathic pulmonary fibrosis (IPF) is a severe and progressive fibrosing interstitial lung disease, which ultimately results in respiratory failure and death. The median age at diagnosis is 66 years, and the incidence increases with age, making this a disease that predominantly affects the elderly population. IPF can often be difficult to diagnose, as its symptoms--cough, dyspnoea and fatigue--are non-specific and can often be attributed to co-morbidities such as heart failure and chronic obstructive pulmonary disease. Making an accurate diagnosis of IPF is imperative, as new treatments that appear to slow the progression of IPF have recently become available. Pirfenidone and nintedanib are two such treatments, which have shown efficacy in randomised controlled trials. As with all new treatments, caution must be advocated in the elderly, as these patients often lie outside the narrow clinical trial cohorts that are studied, and the benefits of therapy must be weighed against potential toxicities. Both medications, while relatively safe, have been associated with adverse effects, particularly gastrointestinal symptoms such as nausea, diarrhoea and anorexia. In this review, we highlight measures to improve recognition and accurate diagnosis of IPF, as well as co-morbidities that often affect the diagnosis and disease course. The gold standard for IPF diagnosis is a multidisciplinary meeting whereby clinicians, radiologists and histopathologists reach a consensus after interactive discussion. In many cases, a lung biopsy may not be available because of high risk or patient choice, particularly in the elderly. In these cases, there is debate as to whether a biopsy is required, given the high rates of IPF in patients over the age of 70 years with interstitial changes on computed tomography. We also discuss the management of IPF, drawing particular attention to specific issues affecting the elderly population, especially with regard to polypharmacy and end-of-life care. Through this article, we endeavour to improve awareness of this devastating disease and thus improve recognition of the disease and its outcomes in elderly patients.',\n",

Previous studies suggest that collagen V overexpression and collagen V-mediated immune response play roles in the pathogenesis of idiopathic pulmonary fibrosis. This study aimed to identify dysregulated miRNA-related collagen V overexpression during idiopathic pulmonary fibrosis. We found that the expression levels of miR-185 and miR-186 were decreased in the lungs of idiopathic pulmonary fibrosis patients. The levels of miR-185 and miR-186 were not correlated with disease severity of idiopathic pulmonary fibrosis. The direct regulation of COL5A1 by miR-185 and miR-186 was confirmed by a luciferase reporter assay. Furthermore, mimics of miR-185 and miR-186 blocked transforming growth factor-beta-induced collagen V overexpression and alleviated transforming growth factor-beta-induced epithelial-mesenchymal transition in A549 cells and HCC827 cells. Our findings suggest that attenuated expression of miR-185 and miR-186 may be responsible for collagen V overexpression during idiopathic pulmonary fibrosis, and these miRNAs may serve as pathogenesis-related biomarkers and treatment targets.',\n",

The aim of this study was to examine the effects of an ultramicronized preparation of palmitoylethanolamide (PEA-um((R))), an endogenous fatty acid amide, in mice subjected to idiopathic pulmonary fibrosis. Idiopathic pulmonary fibrosis was induced in male mice by a single intratracheal administration of saline with bleomycin sulphate (1mg/kg body weight) in a volume of 100muL. PEA-um((R)) was injected intraperitoneally at 1, 3 or 10mg/kg 1h after bleomycin instillation and daily thereafter. Animals were sacrificed after 7 and 21days by pentobarbitone overdose. One cohort of mice was sacrificed after seven days of bleomycin administration, followed by bronchoalveloar lavage and determination of myeloperoxidase activity, lung edema and histopathology features. In the 21-day cohort, mortality was assessed daily, and surviving mice were sacrificed followed by the above analyses together with immunohistochemical localization of CD8, tumor necrosis factor-alpha, CD4, interleukin-1beta, transforming growth factor-beta, inducible nitric oxide synthase and basic fibroblast growth factor. Compared to bleomycin-treated mice, animals that received also PEA-um((R)) (3 or 10mg/kg) had significantly decreased weight loss, mortality, inflammation, lung damage at the histological level, and lung fibrosis at 7 and 21days. PEA-um((R)) (1mg/kg) did not significantly inhibit the inflammation response and lung fibrosis. This study demonstrates that PEA-um((R)) (3 and 10mg/kg) reduces the extent of lung inflammation in a mouse model of idiopathic pulmonary fibrosis.'}"
