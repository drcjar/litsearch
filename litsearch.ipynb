The mode of genetic transmission of this disease, however, has been uncertain until now. The author observed three unequivocal and five probable cases of familial fibrocystic pulmonary dysplasia among 56 members of one family. Diagnostic criteria included progressive dyspnea and cyanosis, digital clubbing, pulmonary hypertension, negative sweat tests, polycythemia, arterial hypoxia and hypocapnia, chest radiographs showing diffuse bilateral pulmonary fibrosis, and diffuse fibrocystic pulmonary dysplasia at postmortem examination (two cases). Among the three unequivocal cases one father-to-son transmission was observed. Non-sex-linked dominant transmission of familial fibrocystic pulmonary dysplasia is thereby proved for the first time. One patient also developed a bronchial carcinoma in addition to fibrocystic pulmonary dysplasia; this is considered to be a cause-and-effect relationship and not a coincidental complication.')\n",

In one case with rheumatoid arthritis and diffuse interstitial pulmonary fibrosis there was ;malignant pulmonary adenomatosis', an association which does not appear to have been reported before. In the second case idiopathic diffuse interstitial pulmonary fibrosis was complicated by large cell anaplastic carcinoma of the lung. It is suggested that in both cases the development of carcinoma of the lung was a complication of the epithelial hyperplasia and scarring that occurs in diffuse interstitial pulmonary fibrosis. It is also suggested that carcinoma found in the main bronchi in patients with diffuse interstitial pulmonary fibrosis should not be regarded as coincidental unless careful search has excluded a carcinomatous change in the periphery of the scarred lungs.\")\n",

The autoimmunisation is a very complicated phenomenon, where endogensou cells are effective as auto-antigens and induce the development of auto-antibodies. From the pathological-anatomical point of view thate are no typical structural changes in the lung, which define a disease as a special autoimmune disease. But the prevalence of round cells in inflamed tissue, the appearance of granuloma with epithelial cells point to immunological phenomenons.

Presenting symptoms were typical precordial pain, fever and dyspnea. Pericardial friction was found in 7 cases and transient rhythm disturbances in 5. Four patients had ST elevation and 3 had ST depression in their electrocardiograms. Other findings included an increased sedimentation rate, leukocytosis, elevated venous pressure and normal SGOT levels. Antibiotics were of no avail but prednisone had a dramatic effect. Two patients had a relapsing course lasting 2 yr or more. One patient, who died at the age of 75 from bleeding ulcer, had patent coronary arteries and mild perimyocardial fibrosis.
