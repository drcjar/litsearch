However, limited data are available on obesity in the setting of ECPR. Therefore, we investigated the association between body mass index (BMI) and clinical outcome in patients underwent ECPR. METHODS: From January 2004 to December 2013, in-hospital cardiac arrest patients who had ECPR were enrolled from a single-center registry. We divided patients into four group according to BMI defined with the WHO classification (underweight, BMI < 18.5, n = 14; normal weight, BMI = 18.5-24.9, n = 118; overweight, BMI = 25.0-29.9, n = 53; obese, BMI >/= 30, n = 15). The primary outcome was survival to hospital discharge. RESULTS: Analysis was carried out for a total of 200 adult patients (39.5% females). Their median BMI was 23.20 (interquartile range, 20.93-25.80). The rate of survival to hospital discharge was 31.0%. There was no significant difference in survival to hospital discharge among the four groups (underweight, 35.7%; normal, 31.4%; overweight, 30.2%; obese, 26.7%, p = 0.958). Neurologic outcomes (p = 0.85) and procedural complications (p = 0.40) were not significantly different among the four groups either. SOFA score, initial arrest rhythm, and CPR to extracorporeal membrane oxygenation (ECMO) pump on time were significant predictors for survival to discharge, but not BMI. CONCLUSION: BMI was not associated with in-hospital mortality who underwent ECPR. Neurologic outcomes at discharge or procedural complications following ECPR were not related with BMI either.')\n",

Emerging data suggests a possible influence of vitamin D on glucose homeostasis. This study sought to provide preliminary information on vitamin D status among Ghanaian type 2 diabetics and assessed its association with glucose homeostasis. METHODS: In a case control study, 118 clinically diagnosed Type 2 Diabetes Mellitus (T2DM) patients attending Diabetic Clinic at the Nkawie Government Hospital were enrolled between October and December 2015. Hundred healthy non-diabetics living in Nkawie district were selected as controls. Structured questionnaires were administered to obtain socio-demographic data. Venous blood samples were taken from both cases and controls to estimate their FBG, Lipid profile spectrophotometrically and IPTH, 25OHD by ELISA. Statistical analyses were performed using SPSS v20.0 Statistics. RESULTS: The average age of the study participants was 58.81years for cases and 57.79year for controls. There was vitamin D deficiency of 92.4% among T2DM cases and 60.2% among the non diabetic controls. Vitamin D deficiency did not significantly associate with HOMA-beta [T2DM: r2 = 0.0209, p = 0.1338 and Control: r2 = 0.0213, p = 0.2703] and HOMA-IR [T2DM: r2 = 0.0233, p = 0.1132 and Control: r2 = 0.0214, p = 0.2690] in both the controls and the cases. CONCLUSION: Vitamin D deficiency is prevalent in both T2DM and non-diabetics. There is no association between vitamin D deficiency and insulin resistance or beta cell function in our study population. Vitamin D supplementation among type 2 diabetics is recommended.')\n",

This study adopted a musculoskeletal modelling approach to determine how the changes to the ST and GR muscle-tendon properties alter their contribution to medial compartment contact loading within the tibiofemoral joint in post ACLR patients, and the extent to which other muscles compensate under the same external loading conditions during walking, running and sidestep cutting. MATERIALS AND METHODS: Motion capture and electromyography (EMG) data from 16 lower extremity muscles were acquired during walking, running and cutting in 25 participants that had undergone an ACLR using a quadruple (ST+GR) hamstring auto-graft. An EMG-driven musculoskeletal model was used to estimate the medial compartment contact loads during the stance phase of each gait task. An adjusted model was then created by altering muscle-tendon properties for the ST and GR to reflect their reported changes following ACLR. Parameters for the other muscles in the model were calibrated to match the experimental joint moments. RESULTS: The medial compartment contact loads for the standard and adjusted models were similar. The combined contributions of ST and GR to medial compartment contact load in the adjusted model were reduced by 26%, 17% and 17% during walking, running and cutting, respectively. These deficits were balanced by increases in the contribution made by the semimembranosus muscle of 33% and 22% during running and cutting, respectively. CONCLUSION: Alterations to the ST and GR muscle-tendon properties in ACLR patients resulted in reduced contribution to medial compartment contact loads during gait tasks, for which the semimembranosus muscle can compensate.')\n",

Larvae of the Antarctic bivalve, Laternula elliptica, were raised to the D-larvae stage under temperature and pH conditions representing ambient and end of century projections (-1.6 degrees C to +0.4 degrees C and pH 7.98 to 7.65). Previous observations using light microscopy suggested pH had no influence on larval abnormalities in this species. Detailed analysis of the shell using SEM showed that reduced pH is in fact a major stressor during development for this species, producing D-larvae with abnormal shapes, deformed shell edges and irregular hinges, cracked shell surfaces and even uncalcified larvae. Additionally, reduced pH increased pitting and cracking on shell surfaces. Thus, apparently normal larvae may be compromised at the ultrastructural level and these larvae would be in poor condition at settlement, reducing juvenile recruitment and overall survival. Elevated temperatures increased prodissoconch II sizes. However, the overall impacts on larval shell quality and integrity with concurrent ocean acidification would likely overshadow any beneficial results from warmer temperatures, limiting populations of this prevalent Antarctic species.')\n",

However, white ginseng and red ginseng have extremely low concentrations of Rh2 or Rh2-Mix [20(S)-Rh2, 20(R)-Rh2, Rk2, and Rh3]. To enhance the production of food-grade ginsenoside Rh2, an edible enzymatic bioconversion technique was developed adopting GRAS host strains. A beta-glucosidase (BglPm), which has ginsenoside conversion ability, was expressed in three GRAS host strains (Corynebacterium glutamicum, Saccharomyces cerevisiae and Lactococus lactis) by using a different vector system. Enzyme activity in these three GRAS hosts were 75.4%, 11.5%, and 9.3%, respectively, compared to that in the E. coli pGEX 4T-1 expression system. The highly expressed BglPm_C in C. glutamicum can effectively transform the ginsenoside Rg3-Mix [20(S)-Rg3, 20(R)-Rg3, Rk1, Rg5] to Rh2-Mix [20(S)-Rh2, 20(R)-Rh2, Rk2, Rh3] using a scaled-up biotransformation reaction, which was performed in a 10-L jar fermenter at pH 6.5/7.0 and 37 degrees C for 24 h. To our knowledge, this is the first report in which 50 g of PPD-Mix (Rb1, Rb2, Rb3, Rc, and Rd) as a starting substrate was converted to ginsenoside Rg3-Mix by acid heat treatment and then 24.5-g Rh2-Mix was obtained by enzymatic transformation of Rg3-Mix through by BglPm_C. Utilization of this enzymatic method adopting a GRAS host could be usefully exploited in the preparation of ginsenoside Rh2-Mix in cosmetics, functional food, and pharmaceutical industries, thereby replacing the E. coli expression system.')\n"
